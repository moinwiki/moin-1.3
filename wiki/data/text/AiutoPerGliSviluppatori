'''TODO'''
 * Collect existing info from the MoinMoin wiki pages
 * Explain extension / plugin concept
 * Start at defining somewhat official APIs (but not before we changed everything to accesses via `request`)
 * Show how to best create URLs (Page.link_to etc.)
 * How to use I18N features

== Contributions ==

The distribution contains a "contributions" directory for 3rd party extensions that are not made part of the official distribution.
This directory contains extensions contributed by MoinMoin users and
that are considered either too exotic or need too much work to be
integrated into the core sources. Another reason of not adding them is
that modules in the core have to be maintained when structural changes
happen, which is a constant burden. 

Thus, these sources are here for you to try them out and take advantage
of a feature someone found useful enough to write code for, but you
cannot expect that they always work with the current distribution.
Contributors are encouraged to send updates... 


== Extension guidelines ==
These are the rules that govern MoinMoin development:
 * All extensions to or modifications of the original MoinMoin:WikiMarkup should be kept compatible and in the spirit of the MoinMoin:OriginalWiki. Example: [http://... text] shows up literally, i.e. no information is lost when cut&pasting to another Wiki.
 * Be portable at all times, at the very least to Win32 and Unix.
 * Keep the simple nature of page storage, if there are performance issues, add transparent caching / indexing.


== CVS structure ==

For historical reasons, the ''virtual'' CVS module "`moin`" combines the "`dist`" and the "`MoinMoin`" module; "`moin`" is the only module you should check out.


== Tour of the most important modules ==

 wikiaction.py:: HelpOnActions lists all the querystrings that are handled by this module.

== Creating a release ==

This describes how to create a release tarball for MoinMoin. It's of minor interest to anyone except MoinMoin:JürgenHermann. :)

 1. Commit any pending code changes.
 1. Commit the current status of the MoinMoin wiki (especially the help pages).
 1. `make install-docs`
 1. Validate the CHANGES file (insert current date and new version number).
 1. Tag the repository: {{{
cvs tag rel-MAJOR-MINOR}}}
 1. Create an export directory: {{{
cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.moin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/moin export -r HEAD moin
cd moin
python setup.py sdist
}}}
 1. Upload the tarball (or zip):
    * [http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/editpackages.php?group_id=8482 SourceForge / Project Admin / Release Files]
    * Follow the forms
    * See also [http://sfdocs.sourceforge.net/sfdocs/display_topic.php?topicid=22 Making File Releases]
 1. Download from MoinMoin:SourceForge and give it a test run.
