=== Built-in test ===

There's a built-in diagnostic mode that's useful when doing an install; just append "`?test`" to the URL of your wiki: {{{
lynx --dump http://`hostname`/mywiki?test
}}}

If you see an import error here, but "`python -c "import MoinMoin"`" works, it's likely a result of missing file permissions or a wrong PYTHONPATH setting within the web server environment.
