== How to install your own MoinMoin Wiki ==
This page describes the installation procedure applying to MoinMoin version 0.11 and up. In the next section, there is a list of real-world [#installscenarios Installation Scenarios] that help you to understand how to apply the instructions in different environments. If you already have a wiki running and want to upgrade to 0.11, see HelpOnUpdating. 

/BasicInstallation explains the "`setup.py`" step of the installation in more detail. This applies equally to all scenarios, and you should read it before trying a live installation.

/TroubleShooting helps with fixing any general problems you might encounter, which apply to any installation platform. 

After a successful installation, you might want to read more about configuration and other options that you, as the wiki administrator, can set up. HelpOnAdministration contains links to pages that cover these topics.
Especially, the HelpOnConfiguration and HelpOnUpdating pages provide additional information regarding wiki setup and maintenance. MoinMoin:MoinMoinWinCvs and MoinMoin:MoinMoinUnixCvs describe how to run your wiki using the current development version from the MoinMoin:SourceForge CVS repository.
