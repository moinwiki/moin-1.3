== Basic Installation ==

Before you can integrate Moin``Moin into your web environment,
you have to do the basic installation using the standard Python
''distutils'' mechanism. We'll explain the usual steps you need to
take to do this. For more details on the distutils installation
process, consult the [http://www.python.org/doc/current/inst/inst.html Installing Python Modules] document of your
Python manual.

 /!\ '''NOTE:''' You will need the Python Development package installed on UNIX systems for distutils to work correctly.

The first step is to unpack the distribution archive, which you
have done already when you loaded this instructions from your disk.
If you read this on the web, the distribution comes in a versioned
ZIP or TAR archive, which you can unpack in the usual ways, into a
temporary directory (`/tmp` on UNIX, `C:\TEMP` on Windows). The
distribution archive will always unpack into a directory named
`moin-<version>`, for example `moin-0.11`.

After unpacking, to install into a specific directory (`C:\moin`
in our example), call `setup.py` after changing your current
directory to the distribution directory. The following commands
can be used to complete theses steps:
    {{{
    unzip moin-0.11.zip
    cd moin-0.11
    python setup.py --quiet install --prefix=C:\moin
}}}

This creates the following directories in "C:\moin" (note
that on a UNIX system, the directory layout will be slightly
different):
    {{{
    MoinMoin
    MoinMoin/action
    MoinMoin/formatter
    MoinMoin/i18n
    MoinMoin/macro
    MoinMoin/parser
    MoinMoin/py15
    MoinMoin/scripts
    MoinMoin/support
    MoinMoin/twisted
    MoinMoin/webapi
    Scripts
    share
    share/moin
    share/moin/cgi-bin
    share/moin/data
    share/moin/data/backup
    share/moin/data/cache
    share/moin/data/pages
    share/moin/data/plugin
    share/moin/data/plugin/action
    share/moin/data/plugin/macro
    share/moin/data/text
    share/moin/data/user
    share/moin/htdocs
    share/moin/htdocs/css
    share/moin/htdocs/img
}}}

You will likely see the following warning:

    warning: install: modules installed to 'C:\moin\', which
    is not in Python's module search path (sys.path) -- you'll
    have to change the search path yourself 

This means exactly what it says, you need to add your install
directory to the search path of Python. There are several ways
to do this:

    Environment variable:: Change `PYTHONPATH` in a way that is
    persistent (`/etc/profile.d` on UNIX, `AUTOEXEC.BAT` on W9x,
    the `Properties` item in the context menu of `My Computer` on NT4 and
    W2K)

    Apache "httpd.conf":: Use the `SetEnv` directive to set
    `PYTHONPATH` to a suitable value, for example: {{{
    SetEnv PYTHONPATH "C:\moin"
}}}

    "moin.cgi":: Directly add your installation directory to
    the CGI driver script, like this: {{{
    import sys
    sys.path.append('C:/moin')
}}}

If you use the following default installation command, Moin``Moin
will be installed to the Python directory:
    {{{
    python setup.py --quiet install
}}}

You won't need to change your `PYTHONPATH` then, but depending
on your system environment you might not be able to use that
command, especially when you are not the root user on a UNIX
system. If you don't know where your Python directory is, this
command will tell you:
    {{{
    python -c "import sys; print sys.prefix"
}}}

The directory structure we showed above will then be created
in that directory. If you're interested in the exact list of
files that are installed, use the `--record` option of distutils.
