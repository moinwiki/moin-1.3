= MoinMoin Wiki =

A WikiWikiWeb is a collaborative hypertext environment, with an emphasis on easy access to and modification of information. This wiki can also link to InterWiki space.

MoinMoin is a Python Wiki:WikiClone, based on Wiki:PikiPiki. The name is a common German slang expression explained on the MoinMoin page. If you run a Wiki using MoinMoin, please add it to the MoinMoin:MoinMoinWikis page. Contributed code is on the MoinMoin:MacroMarket, MoinMoin:ActionMarket and MoinMoin:ParserMarket pages. For more details and further topics, see the MoinMoin page.
