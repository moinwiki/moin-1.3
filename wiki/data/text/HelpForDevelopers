== Helping with MoinMoin development ==

MoinMoin would miss quite some features were it not for the help of some of its users. What you can do to improve MoinMoin, also for your own benefit:
 * develop new extensions (macros, actions, processors, parsers)
 * run the CVS version and help testing the new features
 * test MoinMoin on a certain platform, or with certain Python versions
 * help with the translation efforts, especially adding new languages
 * ...

In any case, you should subscribe to the [http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/moin-devel MoinMoin Developer List]. More information on MoinMoin source code and other developer issues can be found in the MoinMoin main wiki, on MoinMoin:MoinDev and its subpages.

== Contributions ==

The distribution contains a "contributions" directory for 3rd party extensions that are not made part of the official distribution.
This directory contains extensions contributed by MoinMoin users and
that are considered either too exotic or need too much work to be
integrated into the core sources. Another reason of not adding them is
that modules in the core have to be maintained when structural changes
happen, which is a constant burden. 

Thus, these sources are here for you to try them out and take advantage
of a feature someone found useful enough to write code for, but you
cannot expect that they always work with the current distribution.
Contributors are encouraged to send updates... 

Another source of user contributions are the 
MoinMoin:ActionMarket,
MoinMoin:MacroMarket,
MoinMoin:ParserMarket, and
MoinMoin:ProcessorMarket
pages.
