This HTML page contains the basic install docs that can be found on http://purl.net/wiki/moin/MoinMoin/InstallDocs. It contains all necessary information to get your wiki up and running, even without being online. If you have a permanent internet connection, you might want to browse the docs on the Help``On``Installing page, which might contain more up-to-date information.

After following the procedures on this page, you should have a working wiki and can browse the rest of the online docs there.

== How to install your own MoinMoin Wiki ==
This page describes the installation procedure applying to MoinMoin:MoinMoin version 0.11 and up. In the next section, there is a list of real-world [#installscenarios Installation Scenarios] that help you to understand how to apply the instructions in different environments.

[#basic-install Basic Installation] explains the "`setup.py`" step of the installation in more detail. This applies equally to all scenarios, and you should read it before trying a live installation.

[#trouble-shooting Trouble-shooting] helps with fixing any general problems you might encounter, which apply to any installation platform.

After a successful installation, you might want to read more about configuration and other options that you, as the wiki administrator, can set up. MoinMoin:HelpOnAdministration contains links to pages that cover these topics.
Especially, the MoinMoin:HelpOnConfiguration and MoinMoin:HelpOnUpdating pages provide additional information regarding wiki setup and maintenance. MoinMoin:MoinMoinWinCvs and MoinMoin:MoinMoinUnixCvs describe how to run your wiki using the current development version from the MoinMoin:SourceForge CVS repository.
