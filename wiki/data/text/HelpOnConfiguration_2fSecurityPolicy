`SecurityPolicy` is a config option that allows wiki admins to dynamically enable or disable certain key actions in a MoinMoin wiki, most notably editing and deleting content.

== Mechanics ==

Security restrictions in a MoinMoin wiki work by the interface defined in the `MoinMoin.security` module.
The `Permissions` class implements the basic interface for user permissions and
system policy. If you want to define your own policy, inherit
from that base class, so that when new permissions are defined, you get the defaults.

Then either assign your new class to `SecurityPolicy` in `moin_config` (and I mean the class, not an instance of it), or define your class directly in `moin_config` and name it `SecurityPolicy`.


== Samples ==

For samples on using this mechanism, see MoinMoin:SecurityPolicy.
