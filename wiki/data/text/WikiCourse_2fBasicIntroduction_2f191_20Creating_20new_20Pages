= Creating new Pages =

New pages are created by simply adding a new WikiName to an existing page and clicking on it after saving the existing page.

This brings up a page with a variety of possibilities to create the new page:
 * click on ''create page'' to start with an empty page or
 * click on one of the listed templates to base your page on the content of the selected template.

Below the list of templates you will also find a list of existing pages with a similar name. You should always check this list because someone else might have already started a page about the same subject but named it slightly differently.
