== Using MoinMoin with apache + mod_fastcgi ==

[http://fastcgi.com FastCGI] is a method which enables apache to communicate
with long-running scripts. This has the advantage that the script is only
started and initialized one time, and that data could be cached in memory
from request to request, enhancing the performance of the CGI application.

=== Deploying MoinMoin with apache + mod_fastcgi ===

To deploy MoinMoin using FastCGI you need an apache with mod_fastcgi. Please
refer to the documentation of mod_fastcgi how to build it.

Follow the basic apache installation for your operating system as described
in other parts of the MoinMoin installation documentation. In places where
the documentation refers to `moin.cgi` you use `moin.fcg` instead. Be sure
that '''.fcg''' is handled by the FastCGI module
(`AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcg` in your apache config).

Normally apache will start CGI scripts with its own user and group, or
with the user and group of the !VirtualHost if you are using the suexec
wrapper. To enable this with FastCGI you need to use `FastCgiWrapper On`
in your apache config (see FastCGI Documentation).

Be sure to restart your apache, after you changed py files (i.e. the config)
for a running FastCGI server, or you won't see any changes!
