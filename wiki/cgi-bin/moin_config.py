    MoinMoin - Configuration

    Note that there are more config options than you'll find in
    the version of this file that is installed by default; see
    the module MoinMoin.config for a full list of names and their
    default values.

    Also, the URL http://purl.net/wiki/moin/HelpOnConfiguration has
    a list of config options.
