/!\ This is pre-1.3 stuff that still has to be adapted to 1.3.

= Installing MoinMoin on OS X =

You must not be afraid to use the terminal. It is possible but much harder to install without the using the terminal.

There are 2 step in the installation:
 1. Install the MoinMoin engine - once
 2. Create wiki instance. You can create and serve as many wikis as you like.

== Download ==

Download the source on the Desktop. You should see a `moin-x.x.tar.gz` file. Extract this file on the desktop with Stuffit Expander, or from the terminal (faster and safer):
{{{
cd ~/Desktop
tar -xzf moin-1.3.tar.gz
}}}

== Install ==

Use these commands in the terminal to install the !MoinMoin wiki engine into the system.

First, open a shell as root. You will need this to install MoinMoin and configure the wiki. When asked, enter your password.
{{{
sudo -s
... password:
}}}
Now you have root privileges in this shell.

Install:
{{{
cd moin-1.3
python setup.py install --install-data='/usr'  --record=install.log 
}}}

 (!) The --install-data='/usr' will put the shared data in the convinient `'/usr/share/moin'` directory. If you don't use it, your shared data will be at `'/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/share/moin'`.

Now installation is finished. You will find a file `install.log` on the Desktop in the folder `moin-1.3`.

== Creating a wiki ==

After you installed the software, you create a wiki. You may create several wikis if you need.

First check what is the user and group name of the web server. The wiki files will belong to the web server (not to you):
{{{
egrep "^User|^Group" /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
User www
Group www
}}}
You wil use these name soon...

Now create a copy of the default wiki:
{{{
cd /usr/share/moin
mkdir mywiki
cp -r data mywiki
cp cgi-bin/* mywiki
chown -R www:www mywiki
chmod a+rx mywiki/*.cgi
}}}

Configure Apache. We'll use the pico editor:
{{{
pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
}}}

Go the end of the Aliasess section and edit like the example below:
{{{
    Alias /wiki/ "/usr/share/moin/htdocs/"      
    ScriptAlias /mywiki "/usr/share/moin/mywiki/moin.cgi"       
}}}
Use Control+O to save the file and Control+X to exit pico.

Restart Apache - open System Preferences, go to the Sharing page, select "Personal Web Sharing" and click "Stop" then "Start". Or just type this instead:
{{{
apachectl graceful
... /usr/sbin/apachectl graceful: httpd gracefully restarted
}}}

Installation finished - exit from the shell with the root privileges - working as root is dangerous.
{{{
exit
}}}
Now you are running again safely.


== Testing ==

In a web-browser surf to the site: http://localhost/mywiki

You should see the !FrontPage of your new wiki.

Now run the unit tests, to make sure everything is fine. Go to this address: http://localhost/mywiki?action=test

You should see a report on the wiki and tests results for the MoinMoin engine. If some of the tests fail, please report the problem on [http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/MoinMoinBugs MoinMoinBugs].


= Comments =

Here are a couple of issues with my Mac OS X install I needed to fix:

 1. The RSS feed for your RecentChanges page may be broken.  You need to install the most recent version of [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyxml/ PyXML].  Here's how I did so and the RSS feed was fixed.[[BR]]`curl -O http://aleron.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/pyxml/PyXML-0.8.3.tar.gz`[[BR]]`tar xzvf PyXML-0.8.3.tar.gz`[[BR]]`cd PyXML-0.8.3`[[BR]]`sudo python setup.py --without-xpath build`[[BR]]`sudo python setup.py install`
