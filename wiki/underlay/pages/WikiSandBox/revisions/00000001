(23:18) <     jroes> ah
(23:19) <     jroes> hm, i like the way {{{ works, but i was hoping the lines would wrap
(23:21) -!- gpciceri [~gpciceri@host181-130.pool8248.interbusiness.it] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
(23:36) < ThomasWal> you could also write a parser or processor
(23:38) <     jroes> i could?
(23:38) <     jroes> would that require modification on the moin end though?
(23:38) <     jroes> i cant change the wiki myself :x
(23:39) < ThomasWal> parsers and processors are plugable
(23:39) < ThomasWal> so you dont need to change the core code
(23:40) < ThomasWal> you need to copy it to the wiki data directory though
(23:40) <     jroes> well, what i meant to say was that i dont have access to the box running the wiki
(23:40) < ThomasWal> then this is no option
(23:40) <     jroes> yeah :/
