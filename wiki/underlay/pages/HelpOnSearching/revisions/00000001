MoinMoin 1.3 comes with a new search engine. The same search patterns are allowed in the search and title search input fields as in the parameters for the `FullSearch` and the `PageList` macros.

 * There may be several search term seperated by white space
  * Terms are combined by default with an AND operation - only pages containing all search term are returned
  * Double or single quotes may be used to include white space into search terms.
 * - before a search term means NOT - pages containing this term are excluded from the result
 * `regex:TERM` is treated as regular expression
 * `title:TERM` searches in pages that their titles match TERM
 * `case:TERM` searches case sensitive
  * normal search terms do search the titles too. Matches in titles get more weight as matches in pages.
 * `title:`, `regex:` and `case:` may be used in combination in one search term
  * these modifiers may be abbreviated to any length: `re:`, `t:`, `reg:`, `cas:`
  * - must be put before any other modifiers
 * `or` operator has a lower precedence than the implicit AND
 * Parentheses can be used for grouping

=== Examples ===

{{{
title:Help macro
}}}
searches for help pages that contain the word "macro".

{{{
apple (computer or "operating system")
}}}
searches for pages containing the word "apple" and at least one of "computer" or "operating system".

{{{
windows winamp or linux xmms
}}}
searches for pages containing both "windows" and "winamp", and also for pages containing both "linux" and "xmms".

{{{
"is text"
}}}
Will match "th'''is text'''" or "'''is text'''s". Quotes are used only to include whitespace, and do not mean "exactly this phrase".

== TitleSearch and PageList ==
 * uses the same patterns
 * `title:` is virtually added to every search term
