Put a headline on top of your page (as you see above) because in [[GetText(DiaShow)]] mode, the wiki page title won't be visible (as the whole wiki frame stuff won't be visible, only the page contents).

If you do not want to enumerate your headlines, use `#pragma section-numbers off` at top of your page.

(!) Don't forget to fill in some valuable content.

For your convenience, there is a SlideTemplate - use it.

Put `[[Navigation(slides)]]` (upper) or `[[Navigation(siblings)]]` (lower) at bottom of your page:

[[Navigation(slides)]]

[[Navigation(siblings)]]
