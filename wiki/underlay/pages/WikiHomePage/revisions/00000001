A WikiHomePage is your personal page on a WikiWikiWeb, where you could put information how to contact you, your interests and skills, etc. It is regarded as to be owned by the person that created it, so be careful when editing it.

When you create one, put the the word Category''''''Homepage on it, like can be seen on this page.

Note that such pages are "owned" by the respective person and should not be edited by others, except to leave a message to that person. To do so, just append your message to the page, after four dashes like so:

 {{{
----
Just saying Hi! -- JÃ¼rgenHermann
}}}

----
CategoryHomepage
