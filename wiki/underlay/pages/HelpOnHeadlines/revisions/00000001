== Section Headings ==
You can create headings by starting and ending a line with up to five equal signs. The heading text is between those markers, separated by a single space.

Headings can be automatically numbered, you can enable or disable this for each page (see `#pragma section-numbers` on HelpOnProcessingInstructions) and for the whole site (see `show_section_numbers` on HelpOnConfiguration).

For more information on the possible markup, see HelpOnEditing. 

 /!\ Headings may not contain wiki markup.

 /!\ You cannot indent headings.

=== Example ===
{{{
= Heading =
== Subheading ==
=== Level 3 ===
==== Level 4 ====
===== Level 5 =====
}}} 

=== Display ===
= Heading =
== Subheading ==
=== Level 3 ===
==== Level 4 ====
===== Level 5 =====

Note that proper section numbering requires you to order sections according to a valid structure, i.e. correctly nested. Our sample doesn't do this, so you get a different numbering scheme than you might expect.
