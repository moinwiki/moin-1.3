== Enabling Email Support ==

Setting both "`mail_smarthost`" and "`mail_from`" in the configuration activates features that are explained below. These features are otherwise not available, since there are no general defaults.

 mail_from:: This value is used for the "`From:`" and "`To:`" headers in the emails sent (the "`To:`" has email address privacy reasons, email is not really sent to this address, but we don't want to disclose any real recipient address).
 mail_smarthost:: This is the IP or domain name of an FOLDOC:SMTP enabled server. On a Unix host, you can try to use `localhost`; on a Windows machine this will normally be a machine in your LAN or some host of your ISP.
 mail_login:: This is only needed when you use SMTP AUTH to send mail; in that case, set this to the username and password separated by a space, i.e. `"user pwd"`.

/!\ If you set `mail_smarthost` then you '''must''' also set `mail_from`.

== Email Features ==

MoinMoin currently offers two email-based services, which are explained in the following sections.

=== Sending Login Data ===

If emailing is available, the UserPreferences dialog is expanded with a field "[[GetText(Your email address)]]" and a button "[[GetText( Mail me my account data )]]". The user can enter the email address he provided at registration and then gets an email containing all necessary data to re-login, after clicking the button.

=== Change Notification ===

Any user can subscribe to changes of wiki pages by either clicking on the envelope icon [[Icon(subscribe)]], or by adding a regex to the "Subscribed wiki pages" field of his UserPreferences. The system then sends, whenever a page is changed and the author doesn't uncheck the "[[GetText(Send mail notification)]]" checkbox, an email with the author, a link to the page, and the diff of the change.
