The DesktopEdition can be configured similarly to a normal MoinMoin installation. You must restart `moin.exe`/`moin.py` for changes to take effect.

= Basic configuration =
Just create a `wikiconfig.py` file in the directory of the file `moin.py`/`moin.exe`. You can use the options listed on the page HelpOnConfiguration.

Here is a sample: {{{#!python
from MoinMoin.multiconfig import DefaultConfig

class Config(DefaultConfig):
    sitename = "My local notebook"
    logo_string = u'<img src= "/wiki/mylogo.png"> My local notebook-Wiki'
    acl_rights_default = u"All:read,write,delete"
}}}
 Note that the last line is needed if you want to disable administrator access for all users. This is very important if you are using your wiki on the Internet.

= Server configuration =
Additionally, you can set some server options like the port etc. in the file `wikiserverconfig.py`. See [:HelpOnInstalling/StandaloneServer#options:HelpOnInstalling/StandaloneServer] for the available options.

Here is a sample: {{{#!python
from __main__ import DefaultConfig
class Config(DefaultConfig):
    port = 80
    interface = "10.0.0.0" # changes the interface where the webserver is bound. use "" for every interface
}}}

= Dictionary =
You can create a `dict` directory in the MMDE directory and copy dictionary files into it. Then they will be found by the integrated spellchecker.

= Plugins/Themes =
Of course you can install plugins and themes like you do it normally. If it is a prepared MoinMoin package file, then you just need to upload it and click `install` on the page which lists all attachments. Otherwise you have to copy the plugin file into the directory `wiki/data/plugin/` followed by the type of the plugin. E.g. for a theme you would copy the `.py` file into `wiki/data/plugin/theme` directory.

You will need to copy `the css` and `img` folders (if you are installing a theme) into a subfolder, which has got the name of your theme, of `wiki/htdocs`.
