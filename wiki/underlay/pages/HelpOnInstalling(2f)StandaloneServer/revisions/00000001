'''Installing and configuring standalone server'''

The standalone server is especially made for local wikis because it does not need a web server installed. Only Python and Moin are necessary!

To install and run the standalone server:
 1. If MoinMoin is not installed yet, preform ../BasicInstallation
 1. Create a wiki instance as described in ../WikiInstanceCreation
 1. Copy {{{moin.py}}} to your wiki directory, where your {{{wikiconfig.py}}} is
 1. If you installed with `--prefix` option, you must edit moin.py and set `docs` to the correct path.
 1. Run {{{moin.py}}}
 1. Access your wiki at http://localhost:8000/

On most cases, the default settings will be just fine. You many want to edit {{{moin.py}}} and change some of the options, as described in the next section.

== Configuring moin.py ==

=== System path configuration ===

If you did a standard install, and you are not a developer, you probably want to skip this section. If not, you might want to add the path to moin and config file, like that:

{{{
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/moin')
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/wikiconfig')
}}}

[[Anchor(options)]]
=== Config class options ===

|| '''Option''' || '''Default''' || '''Comment''' ||
|| docs || {{{'/usr/share/moin/wiki/htdocs'}}} || Path to moin shared files. If you used `--prefix` install, the default path will not work, and you must set the path to {{{'PREFIX/share/moin/wiki/htdocs'}}}. ||
|| user || {{{'www-data'}}} || If you run as root, the server will run with as this user ||
|| group || {{{'www-data'}}} || If you run as root, the server will run with as this group ||
|| port || {{{8000}}} || Port to serve. To serve privileged port under 1024 you will have to run as root ||
|| interface || {{{'localhost'}}} || The interface the server will listen to. The default will listen only to localhost. Set to {{{''}}} to listen to all.||
|| logPath || {{{'moin.log'}}} || Log file. Default is commented. ||
|| serverClass || {{{'ThreadPoolServer'}}}, {{{'ThreadingServer'}}}, {{{'ForkingServer'}}}, {{{'SimpleServer'}}} || The server type to use, see the comments in the {{{moin.py}}}. The default is {{{'ThreadPoolServer'}}}, which create a pool of threads and reuse them for new connections. ||
|| threadLimit || {{{10}}} || How many threads to create. ||
|| requestQueueSize || {{{50}}} || The count of socket connection requests that are buffered by the operating system. ||

 (!) There may be more options useful to moin developers, see the comments in {{{moin.py}}}


== Configuring wikiconfig.py ==

The sample config file should be just fine.

|| '''Option''' || '''Default''' || '''Comment''' ||
|| url_prefix || '/wiki' || You should not change this, or images and css file will not be available to the wiki! ||

== Starting the server ==

Run {{{moin.py}}} from the command line:
{{{
$ ./moin.py
Serving on localhost:8000
}}}

Test your wiki at http://localhost:8000/

On Windows, you can double click {{{moin.py}}} to start the server. A new terminal window will be opened. Close the window or press {{{Control + Pause}}} to stop the server.

On Unix, interrupt the server with {{{Control + C}}} in order to shut it down.

== Serving port 80 on Unix ==

On GNU/Linux, Mac OS X or other Posix like OS, you can serve the standard port 80 used for web serving, but you must run as {{{root}}} for this.
 
Set {{{port}}} to 80, and verify that {{{user}}} and {{{group}}} exists on your system. If not, set them to an existing user, meant for web serving. If needed, {{{chown}}} your wiki dir to this user and group.

Run {{{moin.py}}} as root:
{{{
$ sudo moin.py
Password:
Serving on localhost:8000
Running as uid/gid 70/70
}}}

Test your wiki at http://localhost/
