== Helping with MoinMoin development ==

MoinMoin would miss quite some features were it not for the help of some of its users. What you can do to improve MoinMoin, also for your own benefit:
 * develop new extensions (macros, actions, processors, parsers)
 * run the development version and help testing the new features
 * test MoinMoin on a certain platform, or with certain Python versions
 * help with the translation efforts, especially adding new languages
 * help developping new themes, CSS and icons
 * ...

In any case, you should subscribe to the [http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/moin-devel MoinMoin Developer List]. More information on MoinMoin source code and other developer issues can be found in the MoinMoin main wiki, on MoinMoin:MoinDev and its subpages.
