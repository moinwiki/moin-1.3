You can use all wiki markup for making your slides - just keep the following in mind:
 * for a Dia``Show, a bigger font will be used, so don't put too much on a slide or you will have to scroll
 * if you use colours, keep contrast in mind - especially if you want to make a printout.
 * presentation will look different on the beamer and on paper as on your screen.
 * if you use graphics, use thicker line width or they will be hardly visible.
