The [wiki:Wiki:FrontPage first ever wiki site] was founded 1995-03-25 as an automated supplement to the Wiki:PortlandPatternRepository (see Wiki:History). The site was immediately popular within the pattern community, largely due to the newness of the internet and a good slate of Wiki:InvitedAuthors. The site was, and remains, dedicated to Wiki:PeopleProjectsAndPatterns. 

Wiki:WardCunningham created the site and his WikiWikiWeb machinery that operates it. He chose wiki-wiki as an alliterative substitute for quick and thereby avoided naming this site quick-web. An early page, Wiki:WikiWikiHyperCard, traces wiki ideas back to a Wiki:HyperCard stack he wrote in the late 80's.
