ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

I like to thank especially these people for their valuable ideas and
contributions:

    Ward Cunningham <ward@c2.com> for inventing WikiWIki in the first
    place.

    Martin Pool <mbp@humbug.org.au> for providing the base of what now
    is MoinMoin.

    Marko Schulz <Marko.Schulz@gmx.de> for providing input on the first
    versions of MoinMoin as it evolved.

    Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp> provided the set of emoticons that come
    with the standard distribution, and came up with the idea to add that
    feature.

    Richard Jones <richard@bizarsoftware.com.au> who provided so much code
    in so little time that I could not keep up with him. He works on company
    time, though (unless I'm mistaken). Also found the nasty security hole
    in release 0.6.

    Christian Bird <chris.bird@lineo.com> provided some nice ideas and some
    code.

    Peter Thoeny and all other people involved in creating TWikiDrawPlugin;
    for copyright information on TWikiDrawPlugin see below; for more
    information and a download link to get the source refer to
    http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/TWikiDrawPlugin

    Thomas Waldmann for the major effort of translating all the help and
    system pages to German, and increasing volumes of code.

    Bernhard Rosenkraenzer and Andrew Bennetts for password login patches.

    And all the people I forgot or that are mentioned in the code.
