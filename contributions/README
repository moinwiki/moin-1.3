MoinMoin Contributions

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains extensions contributed by MoinMoin users and
that are considered either too exotic or need too much work to be
integrated into the core sources. Another reason of not adding them is
that modules in the core have to be maintained when structural changes
happen, which is a constant burden. 

Thus, these sources are here for you to try them out and take advantage
of a feature someone found useful enough to write code for, but you
cannot expect that they always work with the current distribution.
Contributors are encouraged to send updates... 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"plugin" contains one-file contributed macros that can be copied to
either the MoinMoin/macro and MoinMoin/action directories, or to
the "plugin" directory in the data directory of a MoinMoin instance.

Most of those macros are copied from the MacroMarket and ActionMarket
pages of the MoinMoin wiki. See

    http://purl.net/wiki/moin/MacroMarket
    http://purl.net/wiki/moin/ActionMarket

These are untested, and not guaranteed to work with the current code
base.

This macro inserts a file-upload box or the uploaded file in the body of
a message, if it is a jpg or gif, or a link to the file otherwise. 

More information is in "IncludeFile.py".
