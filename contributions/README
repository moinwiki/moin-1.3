MoinMoin Contributions
======================

This directory contains extensions contributed by MoinMoin users and
that are considered either too exotic or need too much work or features
not done yet to be integrated into the core sources.

Another reason of not adding them is that modules in the core have to be
maintained when structural changes happen, which is a constant burden. 

Thus, these sources are here for you to try them out and take advantage
of a feature someone found useful enough to write code for, but you
cannot expect that they always work with the current distribution.
Contributors are encouraged to send updates...

"utf8-pages" contains wiki pages in utf-8 character set. We can not put them
into wiki/data/text yet, as everything else there is currently iso8859-1. If
you run your wiki with utf-8 charset, you can copy these pages to your text
directory. If you mix them with iso8859-1 pages, expect some weird wrong
characters on non-english iso8859-1 pages.

We plan to move to utf-8 as default wiki charset soon, so these pages can
be integrated and not kept separate.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"plugin" contains one-file contributed macros that can be copied to
either the MoinMoin/macro and MoinMoin/action directories, or to
the "plugin" directory in the data directory of a MoinMoin instance.

Most of those macros are copied from the MacroMarket and ActionMarket
pages of the MoinMoin wiki. See

    http://purl.net/wiki/moin/MacroMarket
    http://purl.net/wiki/moin/ActionMarket

These are untested, and not guaranteed to work with the current code
base.

This macro inserts a file-upload box or the uploaded file in the body of
a message, if it is a jpg or gif, or a link to the file otherwise.
