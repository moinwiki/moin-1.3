= Help on the IncludeFile Macro =

The macro name is "IncludeFile()"

To use it, just insert the "IncludeFile" macro in the body of your WikiWiki document, with a name for the document to be uploaded. The only 
constraint is to respect the extension of the document.

||'''Example'''||||
||'''Type of document'''||extension||
||word document||.doc||
||picture||.gif or .jpg||
|| excel spreadsheet||.xls||
||etc.||||

the syntax is {{{

    [[IncludeFile("Your Document Name.jpg")]]

}}}

example:

||'''Example'''||
||[[IncludeFile("IncludeFile Example of Syntax.jpg")]]||

When the page is saved, WikiWiki evaluates the Macro, and if the file(s) that match(es) the name given as a parameter to the macro has not been already uploaded, then WikiWiki will ask you to upload the file(s).

||'''Example'''||
||[[IncludeFile("IncludeFile Example of loading a file.jpg")]]||

You can use the browse button to locate the file to be loaded:

||'''Example'''||
||[[IncludeFile("IncludeFile Example of selecting a file.jpg")]]||

/!\ You should respect the extension of the file name that has been provided as a paramter to the Macro.

If the file is a picture (gif, jpg, jpeg, png) then the picture will be inserted in line in the page.

Otherwise, a link to the file will be created.

The result of the Demo will be:

||'''Example'''||
||[[IncludeFile("IncludeFile Example of result.jpg")]]||

Because IncludeFile does not add any formatting, it is possible to include elements in the flow of the text.

||'''Example'''||
||{{{ I wanted to share [[IncludeFile("god interview.pdf")]] with all the readers [[IncludeFile("devilish smiley.gif")]] because it is fun }}} ||
|| I wanted to share [[IncludeFile("god interview.pdf")]] with all the readers [[IncludeFile("devilish smiley.gif")]] because it is fun ||

All WikiWiki files are stored in [http://guzzi.systems.dhl.com/PhpMyExplorer/index.php3?chemin=.%2FWikiWiki&tri=NomASC ATP Web Based File System]

Enjoy!
