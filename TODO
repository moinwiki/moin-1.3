A larger list of ideas and open items is on

    http://purl.net/wiki/moin/MoinMoinTodo

This is a list of short-term items scheduled for development:

    * support for attachments in moin-dump

    * implement abstract storage classes for all data
        * started on Edit LogBase/LogText storage
        * dbhash implementation
        * other storages for users, pages, cache, etc.
        * mysql implementation
        * tools to convert between storages (XML ex/import)

    * refactor output formatters so that easy XML generation
      is possible (SAX stream, or similar event stream)

    * work on documentation, both external and in code
        * prio #1: change install docs to reflect use of setup.py
        * prio #2: document config options

    * invest further work to make MoinMoin compatible to
      systems with persistence (i.e. globally use & pass
      around "Request" object)
