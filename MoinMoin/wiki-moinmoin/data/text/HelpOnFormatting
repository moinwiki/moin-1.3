== Text Formatting Rules ==

Leave blank lines between paragraphs.

You can render text in ''italics'' or '''bold'''.
To write italics, enclose the text in double single quotes.
To write bold, enclose the text in triple single quotes.

To insert program source without reformatting in a {{{monospace font}}}, use three curly braces:
{{{
10 PRINT "Hello, world!"
20 GOTO 10
}}}

For more information on the possible markup, see HelpOnEditing.

=== Example ===
{{{
Mixing ''italics'' and '''bold''':
 * '''''Mix''' at the beginning''
 * '''''Mix'' at the beginning'''
 * '''Mix at the ''end'''''
 * ''Mix at the '''end'''''

An { { {inline code sequence} } } has the start and end markers on the same line.

A code display has them on different lines: { { {
'''No''' markup here!
} } }
}}} 
/!\ In the above example, we "escaped" the markers for source code sequences by inserting spaces between the curly braces.

=== Display ===
Mixing ''italics'' and '''bold''':
 * '''''Mix''' at the beginning''
 * '''''Mix'' at the beginning'''
 * '''Mix at the ''end'''''
 * ''Mix at the '''end'''''

An {{{inline code sequence}}} has the start and end markers on the same line.

A code display has them on different lines: {{{
'''No''' markup here!
}}}
