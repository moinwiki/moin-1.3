Names of pages have to LookLikeThis.
It's called a WikiName.
If you write a word that LookLikeThis, it will be automatically turned into a link.

Leave blank lines between paragraphs.

You can also write ''italics'' and '''bold'''.
To write italics, enclose the text in double single quotes.
To write bold, enclose the text in triple single quotes.
If you can't figure out what I mean, click EditText to look at the source for this page.

If you indent text

  like this, then it is indented in the output

    you can have multiple levels of indent

And if you put asterisks at the start of the line

  * you get a 
  * bulleted
  * list
    * which can also be indented
      * to several levels

A numbered list, mixed with bullets:
  1. one
  1. two
     1. one
        * bullet 1
        * bullet 2
     1. two
  1. three
     * bullet
        1. one

To insert program source without reformatting in a monospace font, use three curly braces:

{{{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    out.println("Hello");
  }
}}}

Just like that.

Now click EditText in the footer to see the markup for this page, and try it yourself in WikiSandBox.
