This is a marketplace for your actions. Please state your name, your email, and the release your macro is developed for (if you used a CVS snapshot, also state the revision number).

Use a special pagename {{{["action/YourAction.py"]}}} and start your macro with the line {{{
#format text/plain
}}}
This way, the action can directly be put on the page without any modification, and as easily copied from that page. See the examples below.

These actions only become available When Jurgenn places them on his system.
They should appear at the bottom of each page.

== Requests ==
If you are not familiar with Python and/or the MoinMoin code base, but have a need or an idea for an action, this is the place to ask for it. Someone might find it useful, too, and implement it.
