 * Solve the problem of the Windows filesystem handling a WikiName case-indifferent (i.e. map all deriatives of an existing page to that page).
 * Check whether the passed WikiName is valid when editing pages (so no pages with an invalid WikiName can be created); this could also partly solve the case-insensitive filename problem (do not save pages with a name only differing in case)
