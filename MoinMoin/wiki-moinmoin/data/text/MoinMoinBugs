 * Solve the problem of the Windows filesystem handling a WikiName case-indifferent (i.e. map all deriatives of an existing page to that page).
 * Check whether the passed WikiName is valid when editing pages (so no pages with an invalid WikiName can be created); this could also partly solve the case-insensitive filename problem (do not save pages with a name only differing in case)

Maybe this too (case of plain indent where adjacent rows are at the same level):

  a
  b
     c

The first is definitely a bug (though easily circumvented), the second is debatable, since without any indenting lines are joined, too.
