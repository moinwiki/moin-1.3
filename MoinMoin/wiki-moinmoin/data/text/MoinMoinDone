Things from MoinMoinTodo that got implemented.

 * Strip closing punctuation from URLs, so that e.g. (http://www.python.org) is recognized properly.  Closing punctuation is characters like ":", ",", ".", ")", "?", "!".  These are legal in URLs, but if they occur at the very end, you want to exclude them. The same if true for InterWiki links, like MeatBall:InterWiki.
 * Smileys :)
 * Page''''''Count macro: [[PageCount]]
 * Headlines:
 = H1 =
 == H2 ==
 === H3 ===
 ==== H4 ====
 ===== H5 =====
 ====== H6 ======
 * Rejoice,
 ||table||markup||
 ||||is done||
 * Check for a (configurable) max size in bytes of the RecentChanges page while building it
 * Inline code sections (triple-brace open and close on the same line, {{{like this}}} or {{{ThisFunctionWhichIsNotaWikiName()}}})
 * SGML-Entities were replaced when saving them a second time, i.e. & #160; without the space had a problem.
 * SpamSpamSpam appeared 3 times in WordIndex. Too much Spam!
 * Added a means to add meta tags to the page header, like: {{{
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;charset=euc-jp">
<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX,NOFOLLOW">
}}}
 * MoinMoin:JürgenHermann is now url-escaped
 * You can now have ["Really special page names äöüÄÖÜß\{[]}/,.-;:_!§$%&/()="?´+*#'~<><|^°@"] if you set "allow_extended_names" to 1 in the config file.
 * Added "action=raw" to send the raw wiki markup as text/plain
 * Added InterWiki links (and now also "normal" MeatBall:InterWiki links)
 * Do a '''chmod 666''' when saving (otherwise, it gets hard to edit, remove, and cvs checkin the pages).
 * '''Bug''': when saving an empty page, we get an exception.
 * EditText now adds the page's timestamp to the FORM, and refuses the save if the timestamp changed between loading the editpage and saving.
 * Make a backup of the page before saving (data/backup/pagename.''timestamp'').
 * Removed the "Reset" button right next to the save button -- a little slip could mean a lot of lost work.  In the rare case one wants to undo all of one's edits, one can just reload the page.
 * Support for I18N, especially German WikiName's (JürgenHermann ;) )
 * Add icons for editing, printing view, searching and help ''at the top''.
 * First change regarding URLs is to remove " from the URL pattern. Then you can put URLs into quotes, which makes nice reading.
 * Numbered lists (PikiPiki seems to have omitted those)

Also look at the [http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/MoinMoin/CHANGES?cvsroot=moin&only_with_tag=HEAD CHANGES file] (click on "download"), which lists all the changes in the most recent developer version (only available via CVS).

== Fixed 2000-10-31 ==
I think this is a bug (case of URL followed immediately by preformated text closing brackets):

{{{just another BoringTest http://www.kalab.com}}}

''--anonymous bug guy''

Definitely a bug (''and now fixed, since it's an inline code segment'').

Does this work, though?

{{{
just another BoringTest http://www.kalab.com}}}

Yes, now it does!

"{{{just another BoringTest http://www.kalab.com}}}" is an '''inline code sequence''' now, and thus a feature, not a bug. Note the different font! Also see HelpOnFormatting.
