Talk about the things on MoinMoinTodo and MoinMoinIdeas in this space...

== PatternTemplate ==
PatternTemplate is a nice addition to the standard distribution set, but if you want to add actual patterns, either consider using the [wiki:Wiki:WelcomeVisitors C2 Wiki] or setting up your own wiki (or ask [wiki:MoinMoin:JürgenHermann me] to set up a pattern wiki).

== Help pages ==
I'm wondering why not use the [http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?AboutCategoriesAndTopics wiki topic method] instead of putting keywords (such as Help''''''On) in page titles?

''Well, why not. Putting it in the title has the distinct advantage of a faster index generation, and also eases the upgrade of existing MoinMoin wikis ({{{cp Help* mywiki/data/text}}}).''

== Edit / update anomalies ==
In MoinMoinTodo it says: ''EditText now adds the page's timestamp to the FORM, and refuses the save if the timestamp changed between loading the editpage and saving.''

I don't like this feature. On WikiWiki I'm able to make a small edit, click on Save and look at the result. Then I just push the back button and do additional changes or correct something I did wrong on the previous edit. This isn't possible on MoinMoin. Of course I can always use EditText again, but this is significantly slower. --MarkoSchulz

''Marko, would a preview-button (opening a new window!) solve that problem for you? Also, note this from MoinMoinTodo: When a save is in conflict with another update, use the rcs/cvs merge process to create the new page, so the conflicts can be refactored. Warn the user of this!'' -- JürgenHermann

'''Good idea =>'''
Of course, one could add a special case by also storing a unique session cookie in a hidden field.  If it's the same client, then we assume they're just pressed the back button and we let them overwrite the changes. -- MartinPool

The C2 and UseMod wikis check the user in case of a conflict.  If the user is the same, the save is allowed.  We presume that users can handle conflicts with themselves.  (This could be a problem if multiple users edit from the same IP.)  --CliffordAdams

	 UseMod lives at http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl

''Cookie mode is planned anyway, and I will add it for that; IP is not unique enough (Proxies!), but IP+User-Agent+Something probably is, I will give this some thought.'' -- JürgenHermann (with an "ü" ;)

It is very likely that cookies will not be available on the majority of internet appliances for a long time, nor will they be available in browsers that do not support them or browsers that block them. I recommend gracefully degrading in the case that cookies aren't supported by the client. -- SunirShah

== Misc ==
 * In MoinMoin, it would be nice for a macro that would allow users to input text, and when they hit submit, it would append their message (along with the date & time) to the end of the file.  You could use this in a News page, etc.  --KeithNaas

 * It'd be nice if changes in diffs were marked with <ins> and <del>: browsers that don't understand stylesheets can't display classes "diffnew" and "diffold" differently. --deltab

=== I18N ===
Now that Python 2.0 comes with a gettext module, it shouldn't be a great
deal of work, to make moinmoin "i18n-ready".  It is a shame that a piece
of software originating from Germany doesn't include i18n support.  Would
you accept patches?  Or may be I have missed something obvious and
translation is already on the way? --PeFu

I ''do'' accept patches (preferably against the current CVS tree), if you want to work on anything, let's discuss it the mailing list (moin-dev) first, so work is not duplicated.

The matter of translation is two-fold: effective & clean inclusion into the source needs the refactoring currently under way, and then there is the matter of the translation itself. If you could translate the Help* pages to German for a start, that would be tremendously helpful.

Regarding Python 2.0: I'm planning to keep 1.5.2 compatibility as long as possible.
