Talk about the things on MoinMoinTodo and MoinMoinIdeas in this space...

I'd like some feedback on TopicMap''''''s...

Try the new [http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/MoinMoin/CHANGES?cvsroot=moin&only_with_tag=HEAD bracketed URL] feature, which solves all (my) issues with URLs. -- JürgenHermann

In MoinMoinTodo it says: ''EditText now adds the page's timestamp to the FORM, and refuses the save if the timestamp changed between loading the editpage and saving.''

I don't like this feature. On WikiWiki I'm able to make a small edit, click on Save and look at the result. Then I just push the back button and do additional changes or correct something I did wrong on the previous edit. This isn't possible on MoinMoin. Of course I can always use EditText again, but this is significantly slower. --MarkoSchulz

''Marko, would a preview-button (opening a new window!) solve that problem for you? Also, note this from MoinMoinTodo: When a save is in conflict with another update, use the rcs/cvs merge process to create the new page, so the conflicts can be refactored. Warn the user of this!'' -- JürgenHermann

'''Good idea =>'''
Of course, one could add a special case by also storing a unique session cookie in a hidden field.  If it's the same client, then we assume they're just pressed the back button and we let them overwrite the changes. -- MartinPool

The C2 and UseMod wikis check the user in case of a conflict.  If the user is the same, the save is allowed.  We presume that users can handle conflicts with themselves.  (This could be a problem if multiple users edit from the same IP.)  --CliffordAdams

	 UseMod lives at http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl

''Cookie mode is planned anyway, and I will add it for that; IP is not unique enough (Proxies!), but IP+User-Agent+Something probably is, I will give this some thought.'' -- JürgenHermann (with an "ü" ;)

It is very likely that cookies will not be available on the majority of internet appliances for a long time, nor will they be available in browsers that do not support them or browsers that block them. I recommend gracefully degrading in the case that cookies aren't supported by the client. -- SunirShah

Some regex for wiki markup are at http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TextFormattingRegularExpressions

''The c2 markup is really very bad from an accessibility point of view. It requires the use of the TAB character (ASCII 009) which is not available in many cases. UseMod/MeatballWiki have more optimal WikiMarkup in most cases, at least with the common cases. It even does indenting in an easy way. See [wiki:MeatBall/TextFormattingRules]. -- SunirShah''

In MoinMoin, it would be nice for a macro that would allow users to input text, and when they hit submit, it would append their message (along with the date & time) to the end of the file.  You could use this in a News page, etc.  --KeithNaas
