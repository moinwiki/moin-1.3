How does one DeletePages? I tried it, by just removing all the text in the textbox, but this gave me an error message:

{{{   '''Traceback (innermost last):'''

     File "/home/jh/public_html/moinmoin/moin.cgi", line 567, in ?
       apply(handlers[cmd], (form[cmd].value,))
     File "/home/jh/public_html/moinmoin/moin.cgi", line 167, in do_savepage
       pg.save_text(form['savetext'].value)
     File "/usr/local/lib/python1.5/cgi.py", line 907, in __getitem__
       raise Key''''''Error, key
   '''Key''''''Error: savetext'''}}}

''Interesting, must try this.''

One Page on RecentChanges is deleted (TestTest). Was this done manually by the admin?

''Indeed.''
