UserPreferences stores settings per user. For this to work, the user has to accept a cookie with an userid (his ''crypted'' WikiName).

Access to the preferences is guarded by the cookie. To regain the cookie should it be lost, the user enters a password. The following actions are needed:
 * Create a profile
 * Login (send cookie)
 * Logout (expire cookie)
 * Preference editing

Preference settings:
 * User's WikiName (replaces IP in RecentChanges)
 * Size of edit box
 * Other things like color, icons, menu?
