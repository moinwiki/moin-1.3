== Template for Help Pages ==
To create a table, you start and end a line using the table marker "{{{||}}}". Between those start and end markers, you can create any number of cells by separating them with "{{{||}}}". To get a cell that spans several columns, you start that cell with more than one cell marker. Adjacent lines of the same indent level containing table markup are combined into one table.

For more information on the possible markup, see HelpOnEditing. 

=== Example ===
{{{
||||||'''Heading'''||
||cell 1||cell2||cell 3||
||cell 1||||spanning 2 columns||
}}} 

=== Display ===
||||||'''Heading'''||
||cell 1||cell2||cell 3||
||cell 1||||spanning 2 columns||
