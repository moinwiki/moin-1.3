Meatball is a loose grouping of people who are interested in online communities, culture and hypermedia. We talk mostly on MeatballWiki and sometimes on the wiki:MeatBall:MeatballMailingList. The original goal was to focus on wiki:MeatBall:CollaborativeHypermedia but topics have ranged from intellectual property to wiki:MeatBall:CyberPunk to the confusion of wiki:MeatBall:UniformResourceIdentifiers. Occasionally, some of us bother to stop blathering and do some real work. You'll find some project journals on MeatballWiki too.
