See ExtensionGuidelines for a set of rules that should govern MoinMoin development.

First things first, some kind of edit locking, with manual breaking & timeouts. The first version should add the page's timestamp to the FORM, and refuse the save if the timestamp changed between loading the editpage and saving.

Write timings to a log file (cgi_log) when configured accordingly, so we can check for necessary optimizations.

Also, make a backup of the page before saving (data/backup/pagename.yyymmddhhmmss).

After editing, do a redirect so that a reload does work as expected (i.e. does not submit the form again).

Other things:
 * Support &''''''uuml; SgmlEntities
 * Configuration ''outside'' the script proper
 * Make it a package, with a small cgi driver (see configuration)
 * Versioning (via CVS), optional
 * Solve the problem of the Windows filesystem handling a WikiName case-indifferent (i.e. map all deriatives of an existing page to that page).
 * HierarchicalWikiWiki's (grouping of different projects)
 * Support for I18N, especially German WikiName's (JürgenHermann ;)
 * Possibly make it a webserver (advantage: configuration is kept in memory)
 * WikiName|s instead of the obsessive WikiName''''''s
 * URLs of the form [http://.... text of the link] (like a "normal" anchor)
 * [include WikiName] (textually include another page)

Security (against the WikiNature, and possibly not needed when we have versioning):
 * Some kind of access authorization, via pages with a special WikiName
 * LockOutList''''''s, like IRC channel bans

DONE:
 * Do a '''chmod 666''' when saving (otherwise, it gets hard to edit, remove, and cvs checkin the pages).
