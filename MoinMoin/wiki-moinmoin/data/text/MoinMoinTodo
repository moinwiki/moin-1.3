This is a list of things that are to be implemented. If you miss a feature, have a neat idea or any other suggestion, please put it on MoinMoinIdeas. 
To discuss the merit of the planned extensions, or new features from MoinMoinIdeas, please use MoinMoinDiscussion.
A list of things that are added to the current source in CVS are on MoinMoinDone.
MoinMoinRelease describes how to build a release from the SourceForge repository.

------
'''CURRENT''' (what to do before a 1.0 release)

 * Inline code sections (triple-brace open and close on the same line)
 * Add ISBN links
    * IsbnInfo page and ISBN macro
    * Link icon to IsbnInfo page, and the ISBN number itself to the main URL
 * Add a means to add meta tags to the page header, like: {{{
<meta HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;charset=euc-jp">
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;charset=x-euc-jp">
<META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX,NOFOLLOW">
}}}
 * Create MoinMoinI18n master sets (and while doing that, document all the new features)
 * Document unix installation (any volunteers?)
 * Document all MoinMoinUrlSchemes (i.e. action=whatever)

'''FEATURES'''

 * Page info: links to / from page.
 * System Info: number of pages, edits, views, whatever.
 * Add hidden field to editor, for two purposes:
    * recognize saves from the same author
    * prevent direct saves from outside (i.e. simple attacks), that did not load and parse the edittext page before saving
    * needs a way to save meta-info for a page
 * Add change counter to RecentChanges
 * Add PyUnit tests (refactor to modules first?).
 * WikiName|s instead of the obsessive WikiName' ' ' ' ' 's (or use " " for escaping)
 * Support &''''''uuml; SgmlEntities
 * Configuration ''outside'' the script proper (config file instead of moin_config.py)
 * Make it a package, with a small cgi driver (see configuration)
 * After editing, do a redirect so that a reload does work as expected (i.e. does not submit the form again).
 * When a save is in conflict with another update, use the rcs/cvs merge process to create the new page, so the conflicts can be refactored. Warn the user of this!
 * Write timings to a log file (cgi_log) when configured accordingly, so we can check for necessary optimizations.
