MoinMoinRelease describes how to build a release from the SourceForge repository.

------
'''CURRENT''' (what to do before a 1.0 release)

 * #REDIRECT (see Meatball) or #PRAGMA REDIRECT (also use # as a comment character?)
 * Add display of config params (lower/uppercase letterns) to the SystemInfo macro.
 * Support some (all?) of StructuredText ('''TABLES''')
 * Support URNs, see http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-daigle-uri-std-00.txt and http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hakala-isbn-00.txt
 * Add ISBN links
    * IsbnInfo page and ISBN macro
    * pattern d{3}-d{8}-d{8}-[0-9xX]
    * calculate checksum
    * Link icon to IsbnInfo page, and the ISBN number itself to the main URL
 * Create MoinMoinI18n master sets (and while doing that, document all the new features)
 * Document all MoinMoinUrlSchemes (i.e. action=whatever)

'''FEATURES'''

 * Support for -- (&dash; ?) and possibly any (Latin-1) SGML entity.
 * A RegisterInterest macro
 * Add a "news item" macro (edit page shows a special form)
 * Implement http://sunir.org/apps/visits.pl
 * Make a sitemap using Wiki:GraphViz
 * Page info: links to / from page.
 * System Info: number of pages, edits, views, whatever.
 * Add hidden field to editor, for two purposes:
    * recognize saves from the same author
    * prevent direct saves from outside (i.e. simple attacks), that did not load and parse the edittext page before saving
    * needs a way to save meta-info for a page
 * Add change counter to RecentChanges
 * Add PyUnit tests (refactor to modules first?).
 * WikiName|s instead of the obsessive WikiName' ' ' ' ' 's (or use " " for escaping)
 * Support &''''''uuml; SgmlEntities
 * Configuration ''outside'' the script proper (config file instead of moin_config.py)
 * Make it a package, with a small cgi driver (see configuration)
 * When a save is in conflict with another update, use the rcs/cvs merge process to create the new page, so the conflicts can be refactored. Warn the user of this!
 * Write timings to a log file (cgi_log) when configured accordingly, so we can check for necessary optimizations.
 * Wiki:WikiWordStatistics (or just add counters to the WordIndex?)
