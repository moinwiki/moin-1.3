== WikiWikiWeb ==
A WikiWikiWeb is a collaborative hypertext environment, with an emphasis on easy access to and modification of information. This wiki is also part of the InterWiki space.

You can edit any page by pressing the link at the bottom of the page.  Capitalized words joined together form a WikiName, which hyperlinks to another page.  The highlighted title searches for all pages that link to the current page.  Pages which do not yet exist are linked with a question mark (or a different rendering in bold red): just follow the link and you can add a definition.

You are encouraged to edit the WikiSandBox whichever way you like. Please restrain yourself from editing other pages until you feel at home with the ways a wiki works.

To learn more about what a Wiki:WikiWikiWeb is, read about Wiki:WhyWikiWorks and the Wiki:WikiNature''''''. Also, consult the Wiki:WikiWikiWebFaq and Wiki:OneMinuteWiki. 

Good starting points to explore a wiki are
 * RecentChanges: see where people are currently working
 * FindPage: search or browse the database in various ways
 * TitleIndex: a list of all pages in the wiki
 * WordIndex: a list of all words that are part of page title (thus, a list of the concepts in a wiki)
 * WikiSandBox: feel free to change this page and experiment with editing

== Wiki Names ==

A WikiName is a word that uses capitalized words. WikiName''''''s automagically become hyperlinks to the WikiName's page. What exactly is an uppercase or lowercase letter is determined by the configuration, the default configuration works for Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) characters. See below for how to handle Asian, Hebrew and other non-western character encodings.

The highlighted page title (i.e. HelpForBeginners on this page) shows a list of all pages that link to the current page.  It even works on pages that are not defined yet.

A question mark after a link, or a different rendering in bold red, means that the page is not defined: you can click the question mark to offer a definition (e.g., NoSuchPageForReal). If you click on such a link, you'll see a default page that you can edit; only after you save the page will it be created for real.

To ''escape'' a WikiName, i.e. if you want to write the word Wiki''''''Name without linking it, use an "empty" bold sequence (a sequence of six single quotes) like this: {{{Wiki''''''Name}}}.

To learn more about wiki markup, see HelpOnEditing.

== Arbitrary Page Names ==
If you enclose a sequence of characters in square brackets and double quotes {{{["like this"]}}}, that makes it a page name. That can be used for specific uses of MoinMoin (like organizing a list of items, e.g. your CD collection, by their "natural" name), or if you want to create a wiki with a non-western character encoding.
