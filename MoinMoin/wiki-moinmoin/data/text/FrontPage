You are encouraged to add to the MoinMoinTodo page, and edit the WikiSandBox whichever way you like. Please try to restrain yourself from other edits for now, as I want to keep this clean and part of the project documentation.

MoinMoin is a Python WikiClone, based on PikiPiki. The name MoinMoin is a common German slang expression, "Moin" meaning "Good Morning", and "MoinMoin" being an emphasis, i.e. "A ''Very'' Good Morning". The name was obviously choosen for its WikiWikiNess. 

''No! Originally "MoinMoin" does '''not''' mean "Good Morning". "Moin" just means "good" or "nice" and in northern Germany it is used at any daytime, so "Good day" seems more appropriate.''

We use it all day in the south too. I always thought it just morphed from a morning greeting to an all-day one. -- JuergenHermann

A WikiWikiWeb is a collaborative hypertext environment, with an emphasis on easy access to and modification of information.

You can edit any page by pressing the link at the bottom of the page.  Capitalized words joined together form a WikiName, which hyperlinks to another page.  The highlighted title searches for all pages that link to the current page.  Pages which do not yet exist are linked with a question mark: just follow the link and you can add a definition.

To learn more about what a WikiWikiWeb is, read about WhyWikiWorks and the WikiNature. Also, consult the WikiWikiWebFaq.
