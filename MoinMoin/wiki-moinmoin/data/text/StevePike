I have recently started experimenting with my own WikiWiki clone called PikiePikie, written in Python, and based on PikiPiki.

You can find the current status of this project at http://pikie.darktech.org/cgi/pikie, and version 0.1 is now available for download from http://pikie.darktech.org/cgi/pikie?DownloadPage.

I can also be reached at mailto:steve.pike@oztourer.nl
