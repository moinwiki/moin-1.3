This is a marketplace for your macros. Please state your name, your email, and the release your macro is developed for (if you used a CVS snapshot, also state the revision number).

Use a special pagename {{{["macro/YourMacro.py"]}}} and start your macro with the line {{{
#format text/plain
}}}
This way, the macro can directly be put on the page without any modification, and as easily copied from that page. See the examples below.

||'''Macro'''||'''Author'''||'''Email'''||'''Release'''||'''Revision'''||'''Sample'''||
||["macro/AttentionPages.py"]||Richard Jones||richard@bizarsoftware.com.au||0.8||1.101||[[AttentionPages]]||
|| ||||||||||This macro lists all pages which have an attention symbol in them along with their last-modified date. Attention symbols are <!> and /!\ ||
||["macro/Include.py"]||Richard Jones||richard@bizarsoftware.com.au||0.8||1.106|| [[Include(HelloWorld)]] ||
|| ||||||||||This macro includes the formatted content of the given page, following recursive includes if encountered. Cycles are detected![[BR]]'''Now part of the CVS version!'''||
||["macro/MissionStatement.py"]||Richard Jones||richard@bizarsoftware.com.au||0.8||N/A|| [[MissionStatement(2)]] ||
|| ||||||||||Generates a "typical" company mission statement||
||["macro/Orphans.py"]||Christian Bird||chris.bird@lineo.com||0.8||N/A||[[Orphans]] ||
|| ||||||||||Lists the Orphan (some call them Zombies) pages (those with no ForwardLinks in MoinMoin)||
||["macro/LimitedSearch.py"]||Christian Bird||chris.bird@lineo.com||0.8||N/A||[[LimitedSearch]] ||
|| ||||||||||Allows searches limited to certain portions of the wiki by specifying a "root" page and searching n links away from the root||



Note that the samples will only work after I added the macros to the active code base.

There are also some UtilityScripts.

== Requests ==
If you are not familiar with Python and/or the MoinMoin code base, but have a need or an idea for a macro, this is the place to ask for it. Someone might find it useful, too, and implement it.

 * A macro for inclusion of images with width/height attributes, alignment, etc.
 * A macro that fetches (and caches!) the RecentChanges of other wikis and thus allows the creation of personal "unified changes" pages
