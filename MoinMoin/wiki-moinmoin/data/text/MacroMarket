This is a marketplace for your macros. Please state your name, your email, and the release your macro is developed for (if you used a CVS snapshot, also state the revision number).

Use a special pagename {{{["macro/YourMacro.py"]}}} and start your macro with the line {{{
#format python
}}}
This way, the macro can directly be put on the page without any modification, and as easily copied from that page. See the examples below.

||["macro/FaqContents.py"]||Tim Bird||tbird@lineo.com||0.8||N/A||[[FaqContents]]||
|| ||||||||||Creates a table of contents for a page, with questions inserted in their various section headings.  The questions should appear in the document preceded by "Q. ".

Note that the samples will only work after I added the macros to the active code base.

There are also some UtilityScripts.

== Requests ==
If you are not familiar with Python and/or the MoinMoin code base, but have a need or an idea for a macro, this is the place to ask for it. Someone might find it useful, too, and implement it.

 * A macro for inclusion of images with width/height attributes, alignment, etc.
  * ;) ["macro/ImageLink.py"] above will do this
 * A macro that fetches (and caches!) the RecentChanges of other wikis and thus allows the creation of personal "unified changes" pages
