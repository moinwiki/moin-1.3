=== Current Discussion ===

==== Use Server Authentication ====
It would be nice if the wiki would automatically determine if a user has been authenticated through a web server and use that for the User.  If I happened to be using IIS, I could set it up to authenticate and then use os.environ['REMOTE_USER'] to find out who they are.  If I were using Apache, I could do the same.  If I were using Orion, etc, etc.

==== EMail send page ====
It would be nice if the page, one is currently reading or changing could be sent to an arbitrary email. This could perhaps be a new action and added to  a toolbar. -- GM

==== Email notification ====
Email notification about changed wiki pages? ''Yes, definitely.''

An alternative is some method of indicating that a particular page is of interest to some person or groups of people. The Attention Page macro on MacroMarket is one attempt towards this end. -- RichardJones

We have a working system for this at Lineo.  The python module for this
is located at [["action/mailchanges.py"]]. Our system
works as follows:

To subscribe to a page, a user puts the word "Subscribers" as a heading, at
any level (preceded and follow it with equals signs) anywhere on the page.
Then a user puts their e-mail address under this heading.  Multiple e-mail
addresses are allowed.  Due to the nature of wikis, anyone can add or
remove their (or anyone elses) "subscription" at any time.  On submission
of the edited page, the page "diff" is mailed to all addresses so registered.

For example, to subscribe to this page, I could just put the following on it:

{{{
===== Subscribers =====
tbird@lineo.com
}}}

==== Structured Text Markup ====
A simple BizarStructuredText markup has been written and is available on the ParserMarket page. It is very similar to the StructuredText that Digital Creations developed for [http://www.zope.org/ Zope]. Its differences are mostly to do with ease of use. I also included the table markup as defined in the standard wiki markup that MoinMoin ships with. -- RichardJones

==== Macro Collection ====
I realize that this wouldn't be part of the MoinMoin itself, but there should be a repository in the download area for MoinMoin macros that people have written. As of the latest version, it's so easy to write macros, there should be a place where we can place macros we've written so others can get them (I've written some macros that people have asked for in other areas of this site, Even a macro that will look for all macros available on a MoinMoin and list them!) -- Christian Bird - chris.bird@lineo.com

Either send them directly to me (jh@web.de) or to the moin-dev mailing list (moin-dev@dragon-ware.com). Then I'll add them to the default distribution or to a new macro collection. 

See the new MacroMarket page. Interestingly enough, creating that page did not require any change to the code, though you can directly rip the macros from the subpages.

-- JürgenHermann

==== Category based headers ====
It would be interesting to throw a custom header (logo graphic, navigational links, css ) based on a tag similar to a ProcessingInstructions tag. ie: #homepage  If no instruction were found, would use site-wide default. This might be non-trivial if header is currently thrown before parsing the page.

General:
 * TopicMap''''''s
 * Versioning (via CVS), optional (not hi-prio, the current versioning works quite nice)
 * Change control? (checkin-checkout support for files??  This starts to get into the realm of workflow management tools... but it'd sure be nice!)
 * HierarchicalWikiWiki's (grouping of different projects)
 * Possibly make it a webserver (advantage: configuration is kept in memory)
  * Consider Mod Snake: http://modsnake.sourceforge.net/ -- it allows one to write Apache modules in Python.
  * or use asyncore.py, a select()-based server-module used by Zope.
  * problem here is that there's a few places that MoinMoin is not really safe for persistence. I'm going to actually go through and document them at some stage (I'm particuarly interested in places where globals are used) -- RichardJones
 * Local anchors and links on a page
 * Maybe add edit locks with manual breaking & timeouts.
 * At least warn the user if a page was opened for editing within the last ''x'' minutes.
 * wiki:MeatBall:WantedPages (a list of not yet created WikiName links)
 * remove the information at the bottom of the page.  I have not seen this on another wiki and it is confusing. example-- config=, total= imports-
   * this is a testing wiki
 * Page background images? ''#PRAGMA BACKGROUND maybe.''
 * tables with lists inside cells?  lists with tables inside listitems?  tablecells that span multiple lines? ''Not very probable, because too hard to implement, and also leaves the "easy wiki markup" realm.''
 * todo.org has  quickhelp on the edit page:{{{
wikiname == WikiWord and [[nonspaces]] (digit and kanji are available) 
http://, ftp://, news://, mailto: automatically linked 
list(3 spaces and *) 
list(3 spaces and +) 
'' italic 
''' bold 
{ { {, } } } for <pre> 
empty line for <p> 
---- for <hr> 
}}}
 * ModularizeForReuse - this is happening right now
 * IdeaForSurveyPolls 
 * HTML escape - '<html>' tag on a line by itself switches on raw html processing until turned off by '</html>', I know this isn't in the "easy wiki markup" realm but sometimes it's really useful eg converting existing docs, more complex tables etc. I have patches against 0.4 .. will add the feature to 0.5 and post a patch soon. Alexei
   * Write a parser (see {{{MoinMoin/parser/*.py}}}) for this
 * Move color management into moin_config.py rather than spread all over default.css.
 * A way to list pages that have no references to them. Zombies as the [http://www.bluetail.com:5999/ Erlang Wiki] calls it.
 * A macro that expands to the current date when the page is submitted. So that one easily can insert it in aid to others that follow the conversation. Maybe something like {{{ [[.sig]] }}} that will expand to whatever the UserPreferences is set to.
 * Is there any way to have incremental backups made over time? If there was, having a single person 'destroy' the MoinMoin would have minimal effect -- simply restore from backup.
  * Click on the blue "i" at the top-right corner of the page: each page has a full history.

----
Security (against the WikiNature, and possibly not needed when we have versioning):
 * Some kind of access authorization, via pages with a special WikiName
 * Lockout-Lists, like IRC channel bans
 * A grant/revoke scheme, much like advogato (different right levels/checkboxes, can pass own rights on to others), with the wiki admin as the root and full rights.
 * Page approval, see Meatball's ideas page.
 * other SecurityNeeds may come up in different environments
 
----
This is what is left from Piki-Todo:
 * Should have a way to attach images to uploaded pages.
 * Implement Edit-Copy as in OriginalWiki.  http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MoreAboutBackupCopies
 * http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?FederatedWiki
 * Show most-often-read pages.
 * Fix atomic-rename and locking of editlog on NT.  
 * Merge implementations of Full-Search and Title-Search
 * Full-Search should also search titles
 * At the top (or bottom), show the last 5-10 pages you visited so you can quickly move around.
   * Sounds like a good idea, depends on UserPreferences though.
