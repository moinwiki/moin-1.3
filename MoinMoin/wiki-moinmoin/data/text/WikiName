A WikiName is a word that uses capitalized words. WikiName''''''s automagically become hyperlinks to the WikiName's page.

===== Question =====
I want to modify MoinMoin to accept single word WikiName''''''s.  I am thinking that there could be some special markup to indicate I want a single word to be a WikiName''''''.

For example:
  $Foobar

The $ indicates I want it linked.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.
