== Processing Instructions ==
MoinMoin processing instructions have the same semantics as in XML: they control the paths taken when processing a page. Processing instructions are lines that start with a "{{{#}}}" character followed by a keyword and optionally some arguments. Two consecutive hash marks at the start of a line are a comment that won't appear in the processed page.

Processing instructions this wiki knows of:
 * {{{##}}} ''any-text'': comment
 * {{{#FORMAT}}} ''format-specifier'': defines the input format for this page, known formats are:
   * '''Wiki''': default MoinMoin wiki markup
   * '''Plain''': normal plain text
   * '''Python''': colorized Python source
   * '''HTML''' ( <!> not implemented)
   * '''StructuredText''' ( <!> not implemented)
 * {{{#REDIRECT}}} ''pagename'': redirect to a different page (see MeatBall:PageRedirect'''''')

All PIs must appear at the very start of a page. An exception are comment PIs, those may appear within a wiki page (but obviously not in pages using other formats).

For more information on the possible markup, see HelpOnEditing.
