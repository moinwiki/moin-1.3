"Moin" meaning "Good Morning", and "MoinMoin" being an emphasis, i.e. "A ''Very'' Good Morning". The name was obviously chosen for its WikiWikiNess. 

''No! Originally "MoinMoin" does '''not''' mean "Good Morning". "Moin" just means "good" or "nice" and in northern Germany it is used at any daytime, so "Good day" seems more appropriate.'' --MarkoSchulz

Mmmmh , seems that I can enrich so more info: "Moin" has the meaning of "Good Morning" but it is spoken under murmur like "mornin'" although the Syllable is too short alone, so it is spoken twice. If you shorten "Good Morning" with "morn'" it has the same effect with "morn'morn'". --Thomas Albl

We use it all day in the south too. I always thought it just morphed from a morning greeting to an all-day one. -- JürgenHermann

''Interesting. I always get puzzled looks from southerners when I use it in the evening. My wife - who speaks more [http://www.radiobremen.de/melodie/plattkurs/plattvok.htm Plattdeutsch] than me - once explained to me, that MoinMoin originated in "Moi Dag" or "Moin Dag", which just means "Good day". I don't know whether the people were too lazy or just mumbled too much, anyway it degenerated into "Moin" or in its emphasized form "MoinMoin".''

''The whole thing gets more complicated since there are so many different flavors of Plattdeutsch. Someone from Hamburg might have a hard time understanding someone from the coast.''-- MarkoSchulz

''Sure. Here in Oldenburg we use it all-day and if somebody uses MoinMoin quite sure somebody else will ask him not to use it because in our Area it is another way of saying "Leck mich am Arsch" - i don't know how to translate it...'' -- PatrickGuenther

''According to BabelFish, that's "Leaking me at the ass". :)'' -- GarthKidd

''Ok, ok, it means "Lick my ass" and i didn't '''want''' to translate it ;) But now i guess it's ok - offended readers may remove this line, i'd have no problem with it. -- PatrickGuenther

Sorry for barging in here, but I guess that is the idea with this anyhow :) I'm from the southern part of Denmark and we also use the term "Moin" - even though we spell it "Mojn"... but i guess that's because a lot of our language is influenced by Platt -- JørnHansen

''Well, Platt is surely an extreme German dialect (or even its own language), so I guess it's no surprise.''

Swedish has the greeting "morn morn", which is a sloppy way of saying "morgon morgon", which means "morning morning" and is thus used to greet people during the early hours. Coincidence? -- ChristianSunesson

How is moinmoin pronounced? [Although it's an open question as to how to represent the phonemes across Swedish, Danish, Plattdeutsch and English... although probably not impossible as they are all 'Germanic' languages...] --Nicholas Spies

It's pronounced the way you spell it... m as in my, oi
as oy in doytshmark, n as in nuts :). 

BTW, one could resolve to accepting *both* theories on
The Origin Of MoinMoin---taking into account the
nearness in both sound and meaning over several
neighbouring languages (Platt, H.-German, Dutch,
Swedish, English...). Platt used to be the ''lingua
franca'' of the Hanse (an early, nautically and
commercially oriented ancestor of today's Internet),
and a lot of words must have been shared among the
people engaged in the international trade across the
North and Baltic Seas.---
G.: 'Morgen': ''early day'', ''next day''.---
E.: 'next morn' approx.= ''next day'' (cf. also E.:
'day' in 'day and night' vs. 'day' in 'every day').---
Perhaps moinmoin even comes from 'moin morn'?---In (N.)
Germany, one often says 'Morgen, Tag, Abend' (in IPA spelling: [mo:en,
tax, a:mt]) instead of the more polite and more
carefully pronounced, official forms 'Guten Morgen' and so on. 

--Wolfgang Lipp [lipp@epost.de]

In Scots, 'morn' can mean either morning or tomorrow. Thus ''the morn's morn'' is tomorrow morning.

--Hamish Lawson

Let´s have a look at van Dale Taalweb (Van Dale Groot woordenboek hedendaags Nederlands):

''mooi (bn.)''

 * keurig van voorkomen, met zorg gekleed
 * van nature knap van uiterlijk => bevallig
 * aangenaam voor het esthetisch gevoel => fraai
 * voortreffelijk
 * aangenaam, gunstig
 * aardig, grappig
 * [iron.] lelijk, erg

So ''mooi dag'' means ''good day'', and MoinMoin seems to be a residual form of this form of greeting.
