"Moin" meaning "Good Morning", and "MoinMoin" being an emphasis, i.e. "A ''Very'' Good Morning". The name was obviously choosen for its WikiWikiNess. 

''No! Originally "MoinMoin" does '''not''' mean "Good Morning". "Moin" just means "good" or "nice" and in northern Germany it is used at any daytime, so "Good day" seems more appropriate.'' --MarkoSchulz

We use it all day in the south too. I always thought it just morphed from a morning greeting to an all-day one. -- JürgenHermann

''Interesting. I always get puzzled looks from southerners when I use it in the evening. My wife - who speaks more [http://www.radiobremen.de/melodie/plattkurs/plattvok.htm Plattdeutsch] than me - once explained to me, that MoinMoin originated in "Moi Dag" or "Moin Dag", which just means "Good day". I don't know whether the people where too lazy or just mumbled too much, anyway it degenerated into "Moin" or in its emphasized form "MoinMoin".''

''The whole thing gets more complicated since there are so many different flavors of Plattdeutsch. Someone from Hamburg might have a hard time understanding someone from the coast.''-- MarkoSchulz

Sorry for barging in here, but I guess that is the idea with this anyhow :) I'm from the soutern part of Denmark and we also use the term "Moin" - even though we spell it "Mojn"... but i guess that's because a lot of our language is influenced by Platt -- JørnHansen

''Well, Platt is surely an extreme German dialect (or even its own language), so I guess it's no surprise.''
