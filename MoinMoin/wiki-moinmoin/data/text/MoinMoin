"Moin" meaning "Good Morning", and "MoinMoin" being an emphasis, i.e. "A ''Very'' Good Morning". The name was obviously choosen for its WikiWikiNess. 

''No! Originally "MoinMoin" does '''not''' mean "Good Morning". "Moin" just means "good" or "nice" and in northern Germany it is used at any daytime, so "Good day" seems more appropriate.'' --MarkoSchulz

We use it all day in the south too. I always thought it just morphed from a morning greeting to an all-day one. -- JürgenHermann

''Interesting. I always get puzzled looks from southerners when I use it in the evening. My wife - who speaks more [http://www.radiobremen.de/melodie/plattkurs/plattvok.htm Plattdeutsch] than me - once explained to me, that MoinMoin originated in "Moi Dag" or "Moin Dag", which just means "Good day". I don't know whether the people were too lazy or just mumbled too much, anyway it degenerated into "Moin" or in its emphasized form "MoinMoin".''

''The whole thing gets more complicated since there are so many different flavors of Plattdeutsch. Someone from Hamburg might have a hard time understanding someone from the coast.''-- MarkoSchulz

Sorry for barging in here, but I guess that is the idea with this anyhow :) I'm from the soutern part of Denmark and we also use the term "Moin" - even though we spell it "Mojn"... but i guess that's because a lot of our language is influenced by Platt -- JørnHansen

''Well, Platt is surely an extreme German dialect (or even its own language), so I guess it's no surprise.''

Swedish has the greating "morn morn", which is a sloppy way of saying "morgon morgon", which means "morning morning" and is thus used to greet people during the early hours. Coincidence? -- ChristianSunesson

How is moinmoin pronounced? [Although it's an open question as to how to represent the phonemes across Swedish, Danish, PlattDeutsch and Enlish...although probably not impossible as they are all 'Germanic' languages...] --Nicholas Spies

It's pronounced the way you spell it... m as in my, oi
as oy in doytshmark, n as in nuts :). 

BTW, one could resolve to accepting *both* theories on
The Origin Of MoinMoin---taking into account the
nearness in both sound and meaning over several
neighbouring languages (Platt, H.-German, Dutch,
Swedish, English...). Platt used to be the ''lingua
franca'' of the Hanse (an early, nautically and
commercially oriented ancestor of today's Internet),
and a lot of words must have been shared among the
people engaged in the international trade accross the
North and Baltic Seas.---
G.: 'Morgen': ''early day'', ''next day''.---
E.: 'next morn' approx.= ''next day'' (cf. also E.:
'day' in 'day and night' vs. 'day' in 'every day').---
Perhaps moinmoin even comes from 'moin morn'?---In (N.)
Germany, one often says 'Morgen, Tag, Abend' (in IPA spelling: [mo:en,
tax, a:mt]) instead of the more polite and more
carefully pronounced, official forms 'Guten Morgen' and so on. 

--Wolfgang Lipp [lipp@epost.de]

In Scots, 'morn' can mean either morning or tomorrow. Thus ''the morn's morn'' is tomorrow morning.

--Hamish Lawson
