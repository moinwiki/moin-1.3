Add to this page features you think are missing in PikiPiki:

 * Should have a way to attach images to uploaded pages using an HtmlFileField.

 * Implement EditCopy as in OriginalWiki.  http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MoreAboutBackupCopies

 * http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?FederatedWiki

 * Show most-often-read pages.

 * Fix atomic-rename and locking of editlog on NT.  

 LeonMar says we should just open the file with an exclusive lock, rather than using a temporary file.   That sounds nice and simple.  NT implicitly locks the file against deletion but not against simultaneous modification when it's open for write.  The fcntl locking mechanism doesn't seem to work, but perhaps there is a separate msvcrt routine which will do it.

 Can we use the same strategy on Unix, or do we have to switch?

 * Clear up the few inconsistencies between normal and magic pages like RecentChanges.  In OriginalWiki they do this by magic markup tags inside the pages, rather than by trapping the names.  This is nice: amongst other things, it means that people can easily and consistently add documentation/explanation to those pages.

 * Merge implementations of FullSearch and TitleSearch

 * FullSearch should also search titles

 * Feature to link to a randomly-selected page.

 * Resolve concurrent updates.
