== Overview ==

Discuss the current HSPH stat comp on HsPhCurriculum.

I'd like to describe some work related to
automatic documentation of S4 classes and
methods.  For information on S4, see
http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/departments/sia/Sbook/

ProposedWork <- click there.

If I understand this wiki system correctly, I can
have readers directly annotate my comments
on this issue.

http://www.biostat.harvard.edu/~carey
includes source for some fairly obsolete
but widely used S3 code.  I'd like to revise
all this using the improved class/method
protocols of S4, but with automatically
validated documentation resembling javadoc
output.

But my sketch of the new approach is on my
laptop! :(  I'll continue later.

Hi, I'd prefer if you'd not add "unrelated" pages to the MoinMoin wiki, as it is part of the standard distribution. And from what I've seen you plan to add quite some pages, so let's avoid the work in later moving those.

Either mail me at jh@web.de so we can open a general purpose wiki, or let's discuss such a wiki on the MoinMoinMailingLists. -- jh

I have just e-mailed you to discuss this.  --vc
