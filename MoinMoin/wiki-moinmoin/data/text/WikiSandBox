Hello there, I want to link to DjembeUniverse page

I like plastic (with lots of '''polyester''')!

Is there some kind of revision control on this wiki. I am interested in
Wikis for project diocumentation use and Version Control is very useful
in this context.

I looked at the info-page of this page and : yes there is a version log,
_but_ User-Ids would be great.

mailto:Norbert.Klamann@klamann-software.de

Cookie-Based user id & prefs will be supported in some later release. No time-frame, though.

get down

would be nice to see some editing instructions right here though.

Yeah, EditingTips is such an obscure name for that. :>
