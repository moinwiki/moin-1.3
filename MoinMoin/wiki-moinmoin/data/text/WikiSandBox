They were surprised about the first subsection on this page.  Imagine the complete astonishment when they discovered that there was a ''second'' subsection!  An important part of this section is its reference to the ExtensionGuidelines.  Be ''sure'' to check it out.

'''''Please Note:''''' ''There has been considerable controversy about several of the above listed alternatives to reading the First Section.  Some people think they are silly.  Some people think they are offensive.  And some people just think that they are a waste of time.  All of these may be true.  However, we stand by them, as we firmly believe that they are '''all''' more interesting than the First Section.''
