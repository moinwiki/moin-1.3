Testing ending punctuation:  http://www.yahoo.com/  (http://www.yahoo.com/)

 (http://www.yahoo.com/), "http://www.yahoo.com", [Some text in brackets]  [Some text then http://www.yahoo.com/].

Not bad.  Maybe ] should be added to the ending-punctuation list (the last link doesn't work).

Smiley handling  :) It's quite nice...

How does it handle editing conflicts? /!\ It just eats the conflicting text :(

''Any things that look especially bad?''

What about characters in ISO-LATIN-2 ? ["z<caron>s<caron>c<caron>"]?

Abc&#353;def (not by default, obviously; you can configure a wiki to support it as the main character set)

Tnx, for help, I'll configure it. Btw, I'm '''totaly''' impressed by Wiki idea. Python implementation rocks ! It's something I always needed, without knowing :)

I'm editing using lynx.  does this work?
