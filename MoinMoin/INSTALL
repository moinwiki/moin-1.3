# INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS #
###########################

The following description applies to a setup using Windows/NT4, Apache 1.3.9
and Python 1.5.2; you mileage may vary. MoinMoin is also tested with Apache
1.3.12.

We will setup the Wiki that comes with the distribution here; you should
first try to get it to run unmodified (apart from configuration changes),
and only when it works create your Wiki in its own directory.

We assume that Apache is installed to "C:\Apache" (with the subdirs "conf",
"cgi-bin", and "htdocs") and that you unpacked the MoinMoin distribution to
"C:\MoinMoin" (i.e. the directory where this file is located). If your paths
are different, please change them accordingly.

The first step is to create a cgi-bin batch file that refers to the Wiki,
so that it can be installed elsewhere. For this, we create the batch file
"C:\Apache\cgi-bin\moin.bat" with the following content:

    @echo off
    C:
    cd \MoinMoin\wiki-moinmoin
    python moin.cgi

The next step is to edit the file "C:\MoinMoin\wiki-moinmoin\moin_config.py"
and adapt it to your particular setup. The only things we need to change to
get things working are the values of the two variables "data_dir" and
"url_prefix". For our situation, we need the following values:

    data_dir = './data'
    url_prefix = '/wiki-moinmoin'

Incidently, those are the defaults. There is one last thing left to do, and
that is to add this line to "httpd.conf":

    Alias /wiki-moinmoin/ "C:/MoinMoin/wiki-moinmoin/"

This enables Apache to find image and CSS files. In order to activate that
change, restart your server.

After that, it's time to test our Wiki at the URL (possibly replacing
127.0.0.1 with your server's domain name)

    http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/mointest.bat

You should now look at the "FrontPage" of the MoinMoin Wiki. Rejoice! To
further test your new Wiki, "EditText" the "FrontPage", save it and click
on "RecentChanges". If your edit action shows there, you have a fully
functional Wiki.


DIFF FEATURE
------------

For the "diff" button to work, you need a diff utility available on your
path, for example by installing the cygwin package available from
http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/download.html

It also helps to have the Python Win32 Extensions installed, available from
http://www.python.org/download/download_windows.html


VARIATIONS ON THE ABOVE
-----------------------

Instead of adding an alias to "httpd.conf", you can also copy the files
"PythonPowered.gif", "default.css", "moinmoin.gif" and "img/*" (i.e. the
whole "img" directory) to a newly created "<htdocs>/wiki-moinmoin"
directory (with "<htdocs>" referring to your global document directory).
Doing so, you do not allow access to the "data" directory (but the data
in there is public anyway).
