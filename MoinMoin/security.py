    MoinMoin - Wiki Security Interface

    This implements the basic interface for user permissions and
    system policy. If you want to define your own policy, inherit
    from the base class 'Permissions', so that when new permissions
    are defined, you get the defaults.

    Then assign your new class to "SecurityPolicy" in moin_config;
    and I mean the class, not an instance of it!
