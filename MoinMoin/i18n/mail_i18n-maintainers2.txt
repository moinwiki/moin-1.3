Dear MoinMoin i18n maintainer / translator,

It looks like your are still unfinished with translation.

Maybe try to finish it soon. If you have partially done the job, please
submit what you have already (assuming that it is in a usable state).

As planned release date has already passed, we will release MoinMoin as
soon as possible. If your translation arrives before last release steps
have begun, it might still get in.

If not, we will include it in development tree of next version, so it will
be there if we release next version (but it is quite probable that we will
contact you again before that release).

Due to the timings and coordination problems with this sort of translation
effort, we are currently thinking about moving this stuff to the moinmaster
wiki as soon as possible (== as soon as we switched it to utf-8).

Please also don't forget to update status here:

Thanks,

The MoinMoin development team
