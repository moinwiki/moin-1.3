Dear MoinMoin i18n maintainer / translator,

It looks like your are still unfinished with translation - keep
in mind that *.po deadline is 2004-12-01.

Maybe try to finish it soon. If you have partially done the job, please
submit what you already have done (assuming that it is in a usable state).

We plan to release MoinMoin soon. If your translation arrives before last
release steps have begun, it might still get in.

If not, we will include it in development tree of next version, so it will
be there if we release next version (but it is quite probable that we will
contact you again before that release).

Please also don't forget to update status here:

Thanks,

The MoinMoin development team
