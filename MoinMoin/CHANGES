Version 0.2 (2000-08-26)

New features:
    * When saving, a datestamp saved in the form and that of the file are
      compared now; so, accidently saving over changes of other people is
      not possible anymore (saving still needs file locking though, for
      race conditions)
    * if the directory "backup" exists in the data dir, pages are saved
      there before a new version is written to disk
    * Removed the "Reset" button from EditPage
    * Added "Reduce editor size" link
    * Added Latin-1 WikiNames (JürgenHermann ;)
    * Speeded up RecentChanges by looking up hostnames ONCE while saving
    * Show at most 14 (distinct) days in RecentChanges
    * Added icons for common functions, at the top of the page
    * Added a printing preview (no icons, etc.)
    * Added bracketed (external) URLs
    * Added support for quoted URLs ("http://...")
    * Added styles for :visited links to CSS
    * Embed image if an URL ends in .gif/.jpg/.png
    * No markup detection in code sections
    * Grey background for code sections
    * Added handling for numbered lists
    * the edit textarea now grows in width with the browser window
      (thanks to Sebastian Dauß for that idea)
    * Added page info (revision history) and viewing of old revisions
    * Added page diff, and diff links on page info
    * Added InterWiki support (use "wiki:WikiServer/theirlocalname"; the list
      of WikiServers is read from "data/intermap.txt")
    * Added "normal" InterWiki links
    * Added "action=raw" to send the raw wiki markup as text/plain (e.g. for
      backup purposes via wget) 

Bugfixes:
    * Removed an exception when saving empty pages
    * Fixed bold nested into emphasis ('''''Bold''' Italic'')

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Added timing comment (page created in xx secs)
    * ISO date and time formats by default
    * Formatted RecentChanges with HTML tables
    * Uppercase letters for the index pages
    * Added PythonPowered logo

Bugfixes:
    * Javadoc comments now get formatted properly in {{{ }}} sections
