      there before a new version is written to disk

    * Added support for quoted URLs ("http://...")
    * Added styles for :visited links to CSS
    * Embed image if an URL ends in .gif/.jpg/.png
    * No markup detection in code sections
    * Grey background for code sections
    * Added handling for numbered lists
    * the edit textarea now grows in width with the browser window
      (thanks to Sebastian Dauß for that idea)

      of WikiServers is read from "data/intermap.txt")
    * Added "normal" InterWiki links
    * Added "action=raw" to send the raw wiki markup as text/plain (e.g. for
      backup purposes via wget)
