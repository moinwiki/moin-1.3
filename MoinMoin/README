ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I like to thank especially these people for their valuable ideas and
contributions:

    Ward Cunningham                 ward@c2.com
    Martin Pool                     mbp@humbug.org.au
    Marko Schulz                    Marko.Schulz@gmx.de

    Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp> provided the set of emoticons that come
    with the standard distribution, and came up with the idea to add that
    feature.

    Richard Jones <richard@bizarsoftware.com.au> who provided so much code
    in so little time that I could not keep up with him. He works on company
    time, though (unless I'm mistaken). Also found the nasty security hole
    in release 0.6.

    Christian Bird <chris.bird@lineo.com> provided some nice ideas and some
    code.
