Version 1.0 (2002-05-10, Revision 1.159)

THIS IS THE LAST RELEASE WITH PYTHON 1.5.2 SUPPORT! If severe bugs
should occur, a maintenance release will fix them.

New features:
    * security fix: "allow_xslt" has to be set to 1 in order to enable
      XSLT processing; note that this defaults to 0 because XSLT is able
      to insert arbitrary HTML into a wiki
    * "action=content" for transclusion into static web pages; emits the
      pure page content, without any <html>, <head>, or <body> tags
    * "action=link" works like MeatBall:LinkDatabase
    * "Preferred language" and "Quick links" user settings
    * Added "processor" concept, processors work on the data in "code
      displays" and are called by a bangpath in the first line of data
    * Processors: Colorize, CSV (see HelpOnProcessors)
    * New icons: "{OK}", "(./)", "{X}", "{i}", "{1}", "{2}" and "{}"
      (see HelpOnSmileys)
    * FullSearch now displays context information for search hits
    * DeletePage offers a textentry field for an optional comment
    * Email notifications are sent in the user's language, if known from
      the preferences
    * @PAGE@ is substituted by the name of the current page (useful
      for template pages)

Unfinished features:
    * user defined forms
    * XML export of all data in the wiki
    * RST parser (you need to install docutils to use this)
    * XMLRPC interface

Bugfixes:
    * Syntax warning with Python 2.2 fixed
    * Macro-generated pagelinks are no longer added to the list of links
    * error codes returned by "diff" are reported
    * fix for attachments on pages with non-USASCII names

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.11 (2002-03-11, Revision 1.151)

Most important new features: file attachments, definition list markup
(glossaries), change notification via email, variable substitution when
saving pages, edit preview, and improved documentation.

Note that the RSS features require a recent PyXML (CVS or 0.7) due to
bugs in the namespace handling of xml.sax.saxutils in earlier versions.
This is (hopefully) automatically detected on every installation.

Statistical features are NOT designed to work with Python 1.5.2 and
require Python 2.0 or higher. Overall, MoinMoin 0.11 is not explicitely
tested for 1.5.2 compatibility.

New features:
    * XML formatting now (most often) produces well-formed, and, depending
      on proper layout of the wiki page, valid StyleBook XML
    * Headers are now automatically numbered, unless you set the config
      item 'show_section_numbers' to 0
    * "#pragma section-numbers off" (or "0") switches that off explicitely,
      and "on" or "1" enables numbering 
    * Added a "contributions" directory for 3rd party extensions
    * AttachFile action, contributed by Ken Sugino; note that you have
      to enable this action because of the possibility of DoS attacks
      (malicious uploads), by adding this to your moin_config:
            allowed_actions = ['AttachFile']
    * "attachment:" URL scheme allows access to attachments, to get files
       from other pages use "attachment:WikiName/filename.ext".
    * New macros: Date(unixtimestamp) and DateTime(unixtimestamp) to
      display a timestamp according to system/user settings
    * Variable substitution when a page is saved, note that saving
      template pages does NOT expand variables. Supported are:
        @DATE@      Current date in the system's format
        @TIME@      Current date and time in the user's format
        @USERNAME@  Just the user's name (or his domain/IP)
        @USER@      Signature "-- loginname"
        @SIG@       Dated Signature "-- loginname date time"
        @MAILTO@    A fancy mailto: link with the user's data  
    * Copied some new emoticons from PikiePikie
        || {{{ :-? }}} || :-? || tongue.gif ||
        || {{{ :\  }}} || :\  || ohwell.gif ||
        || {{{ >:> }}} || >:> || devil.gif  ||
        || {{{ %)  }}} || %)  || eyes.gif   ||
        || {{{ @)  }}} || @)  || eek.gif    ||
        || {{{ |)  }}} || |)  || tired.gif  ||
        || {{{ ;)) }}} || ;)) || lol.gif    ||
    * AbandonedPages macro
    * Added definition list markup: {{{<whitespace>term:: definition}}}
    * Added email notification features contributed by Daniel Saß
    * SystemInfo: show "Entries in edit log"
    * Added "RSS" icon to RecentChanges macro and code to generate a
      RecentChanges RSS channel, see
          http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?UnifiedRecentChanges
      for details
    * Added config.sitename and config.interwikiname parameter
    * Better WikiFarm support:
      * <datadir>/plugin/macro and <datadir>/plugin/action can be used
        to store macros and actions local to a specific wiki instance
      * config.shared_intermap can contain a pathname to a shared
        "intermap.txt" file (i.e. one stored outside the datadir)
    * added `backtick` shortcut for {{{inline literal}}} (has to be
      enabled by "backtick_meta=1" in the config file); note that ``
      is then a shorter replacement for '''''' escaping
    * added inline search fields (at the bottom of each page)
    * Added preview to the editor, including spell checking
    * New languages: Chinese (Changzhe Han) and Portuguese (Jorge
      Godoy), updated French (Lucas Bruand), added Korean (Hye-Shik
      Chang) and Italian (Lele Gaifax)
    * New SystemAdmin macro
    * `[[Anchor(anchorname)]]` macro to insert anchors into a page,
      and [#anchorname Anchor Links].
    * User option to open editor view via a double-click
    * Added commentary field to editor, recent changes and page info
    * Page trails (user option)
    * UserPreferences: checkboxes for double-click edit, page trail,
      fancy links, emoticons, jump to last page visited, and some
      other yes/no options
    * "config.nonexist_qm" is now the default for a user setting
    * `[[GetText(text)]]` macro loads I18N texts (mainly intended
      for use on Help pages)
    * table attributes via "||<attrlist> ... ||", more details on
      http://purl.net/wiki/moin/HelpOnTables
    * PythonFaq interwiki tag and support for $PAGE placeholder
    * event logging, as the basis for future statistics
    * "moin-dump" command line tool to create a static copy of
      the wiki content
    * "config.external_diff" allows to set an exact path to the
      command, or change the name to for example "gdiff" if GNU
      diff is not a native command in your UNIX flavour
    * `[[PageSize]]` macro
    * the interwiki name "Self" now always points to the own wiki
    * config.title1 and config.title2 are inserted into the output
      right before and after the system title html code (title1
      is right after the <body> tag and normally undefined, title2
      defaults to the "<hr>" above the page contents)
    * Additional link on diff pages to ignore whitespace changes
    * Subpages (config.allow_subpages, config.page_icons_up)
    * ^superscript^ markup
    * `[[FootNote]]` macro
    * many other new config options, see HelpOnConfiguration for
      a complete list
    * [[StatsChart(type)]] shows statistical charts (currently
      defined types: hitcounts, pagesize, useragents)
    * 'inline:' scheme works like 'attachment:', but tries to
      inline the content of the attachment into the page;
      currently knows about "*.py" sources and colorizes them
    * support for Java applet "TWikiDrawPlugin" via
      drawing:<drawingname> URL scheme (you need to activate
      the AttachFile action if you want drawings)
    * numeric entities (&#nnnnn;) are now optionally NOT escaped,
      which allows you to insert more characters into a Latin-1
      page, especially the Euro symbol
    * navi_bar is now a list of page names which should be linked
      on every page
    * test.cgi is now rolled into moin.cgi, and can be called
      by adding "?test" to the wiki base URL. Also, as a security
      feature, the server's environment is only shown for requests
      local to the web server.

Unfinished features:
    * user defined forms
    * XML export of all data in the wiki

Documentation:
    * extended the online help ("Help*" pages)
    * German help pages (thanks to Thomas Waldmann)

Bugfixes:
    * #425857: python Parser bug on the second call
    * #424917: Caching control
    * #465499: Two HTTPS problems
    * #491155: FrontPage hardcoded
    * Handling of inbound UTF-8 encoded URIs (only with Python >= 2.0)
    * Fix for subtle changes in "re" of Python 2.2
    * User-provided URLs are now never URL-escaped, which allows appending
      #anchors and using %20 for spaces in InterWiki links

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.10 (2001-10-28, Revision 1.134)

This version is still Python 1.5.2 compatible, but it's not extensively
tested for that version and some parts of the system might not work
there, especially seldom used macros and actions. Bug reports welcome!

New features:
    * "#deprecated" processing instruction
    * config entry "SecurityPolicy" to allow for customized permissions
      (see "security.py" for more)
    * added distutils support
    * though not extensively tested, the standalone server now does POST
      requests, i.e. you can save pages; there are still problems with
      persistent global variables! It only works for Python >= 2.0.
    * "bang_meta" config variable and "!NotWikiWord" markup
    * "url_mappings" config variable to dynamically change URL prefixes
      (especially useful in intranets, when whole trees of externally
      hosted documents move around)
    * setting "mail_smarthost" and "mail_from" activates mailing
      features (sending login data on the UserPreferences page)
    * very useful for intranet developer wikis, a means to view pydoc
      documentation, formatted via a XSLT stylesheet, for details see
      http://purl.net/wiki/python/TeudViewer?module=MoinMoin.macro.TeudView
      or MoinMoin/macro/TeudView.py
    * "LocalSiteMap" action by Steve Howell <showell@zipcon.com>
    * Added FOLDOC to intermap.txt

Bugfixes:
    * Full config defaults, import MoinMoin now works w/o moin_config.py
    * Better control over permissions with config.umask
    * Bugfix for a UNIX time billenium bug (affecting RecentChanges
      sorting and page diffs)
    * data paths with directory names containing dots caused problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9 (2001-05-07)

New features:
    * XML page input (pages that start with "<?xml") and XSLT formatting
    * Page caching, for now limited to XSLT processing (where it's
      absolutely needed); new code & API to add the "RefreshCache" link
    * Selection of common date/time formats in UserPreferences
    * New action "titleindex" to support wiki introspection (MetaWiki);
      see the new links below the index bar in "TitleIndex"
    * UserPreferences: editable CSS URL for personal styles
    * PageInfo: the editor's name or IP is shown for each change
    * WantedPages: a new macro that lists links to non-existent pages

    * Extensions to the FullSearch macro (see HelpOnMacros)
    * Python syntax highlighting
    * "DeletePage" action (has to be activated, see MoinMoinFaq)
    * "Remove trailing whitespace from each line" option in the editor

Bugfixes:
    * The editor now sends a "no-cache" HTTP header
    * "PageList" results are now sorted
	* New config parameter "html_head_queries": send additional header
      for all pages EXCEPT the "normal" view; main usage is to have
      only the normal pages indexed by a spider, not the edit, print,
      etc. views (which cause multiple hits on the same information)
    * Store the modification time of the page file in the editlog, not
      the current time when the log entry is created

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

New features:
    * When saving, a datestamp saved in the form and that of the file are

      not possible anymore (saving still needs file locking though, for

      of WikiServers is read from "data/intermap.txt")
    * Added "normal" InterWiki links
