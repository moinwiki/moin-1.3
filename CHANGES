Version 1.2.4 (2004-10-23, Revision 1.187)

This will probably be the last 1.2.x release as we are soon doing release
candidates for 1.3 release (with big internal changes) and are expecting
release 1.3 in december 2004.

Fixes:
    * fixed "None" pagename bug in fullsearch/titlesearch
    * fixed projection CSS usage
    * the compiled page is removed when a page is deleted, so no ghost page
      appears after deletion
    * fixed AbandonedPages day-break problem
    * fixed [[GetVal(WikiDict,key)]]
    * the msg box is now outside content div on PageEditor, too
    * privacy fix for email notifications: you don't see other email addresses
      in To: any more. mail_from is now also used for To: header field, but
      we don't really send email to that address.
    * privacy fix for /MoinEditorBackup pages that were made on previews of
      pages that were not saved in the end
    * fix double content div on PageEditor preview

Other changes:
    * workaround for broken Microsoft Internet Explorer, the page editor now
      stops expanding to the right (e.g. with rightsidebar theme).
      Nevertheless it is a very good idea to use a non-broken and more secure
      browser like Mozilla, Firefox or Opera!

    * from MoinMoin.util.antispam import SecurityPolicy in your
      moin_config.py will protect your wiki from at least the known spammers.
      See MoinMoin:AntiSpamGlobalSolution for details.

    * xmlrpc plugin for usage logging, currently used for antispam accesses

    * (re-)added configurable meta tags:
        * html_head_queries = '''<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow">\n'''
        * html_head_posts   = '''<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow">\n'''
        * html_head_index   = '''<meta name="robots" content="index,follow">\n'''
        * html_head_normal  = '''<meta name="robots" content="index,nofollow">\n'''

    * i18n updates/fixes, new: nb

    * New UserPreferences switch:
      you may subscribe to trivial changes (when you want to be notified about ALL
      changes to pages, even if the author deselected to send notifications).

    * New AttachList and AttachInfo macros - thanks to Nigel Metheringham and
      Jacob Cohen.

Version 1.2.3 (2004-07-21, Revision 1.186)

Fixes:
    * fixed NameError "UnpicklingError" in user.py
    * fixed version number in moin.spec
    * reverts done by bots or leechers
      There was a bad, old bug that triggered if you did not use ACLs. In that
      case, moin used some simple (but wrong and incomplete) function to
      determine what a user (or bot) may do or may not do. The function is now
      fixed to allow only read and write to anon users, and only delete and
      revert to known users additionally - and disallow everything else.
    * avoid creation of unneccessary pages/* directories
    * removed double content divs in general info and history info pages
    * fixed wiki xmlrpc getPageHTML
    * fixed rightsidebar logout URL, also fixed top banner to link to FrontPage
    * use config.page_front_page and .page_title_index for robots meta tag
      (whether it uses index,follow or index,nofollow), not hardcoded english
      page names
    * ACL security fix for PageEditor, thanks to Dr. Pleger for reporting
    * default options for new users are same as for anon users

Other changes:
    * do not show excluded actions at bottom of page
    * i18n updated: ja, de, zh
    * editor: removed the columns size setting, just using 100% of browser
      window width (it didn't work because of that anyway). Also removed that
      "reduce editor size" link at top of editor as you would lose your
      changes when using it.


Version 1.2.2 (2004-06-06, Revision 1.185)

Fixes:
    * python related:
     * own copy of difflib removed
       Until moin 1.2.1 we had our own copy of python 2.2.3's difflib coming
       with moin. This was to work around some problems with broken older 2.2
       python installations. We removed this now because if you have py 2.3,
       there is even a better difflib coming with python (and that fixes an
       extremely slow diff calculation happening in some rare cases).
       So the good news is that when you run python 2.3, you don't need to do
       anything and it will run great. If you run python 2.2.3, it will mostly
       work good and you also don't need to do anything. The bad news is that
       if you run an old and broken 2.2 installation (2.2.1, maybe 2.2.2) you
       will have to fix it on your own (just copy difflib.py from python 2.2.3
       over to your python 2.2.x installation).
       But better upgrade to python 2.3 (for debian woody, there's a backport),
       as 2.3 generally runs better and faster than 2.2.
     * scripts changed to use #!/usr/bin/env python (not /usr/bin/python2.2)

    * user accounts and ACLs:
     * we now require the user to specify a password for a new account (you
       were not able to login without a password anyway)
     * it is not allowed any more to create user accounts with user names
       matching config.page_group_regex - please check manually that you do
       not already have such users existing (like a user named "AdminGroup"):
       cd data/user ; grep name=.*Group *  # there should be no output!
     * subscription email sending now honours ACLs correctly

    * markup / rendering / user interface fixes:
     * fixed merging multiple lines indented by the same amount of blanks
     * ## comments don't break tables in two parts
     * added a "remove bookmark" link to RecentChanges
     * fixed DeletePage / RenamePage / SpellCheck to work on subpages, too
     * fixed action=titleindex (added \n after each entry)

    * RSS fixes:
     * non-ASCII characters should work now
     * RSS feed (Recentchanges?action=rss_rc) gives UTC timestamps now
     * removed attribute breaking RSS feed on RecentChanges

    * better email generation:
     * if you use python >=2.2.2, we add a Message-ID header to emails
     * if you use python 2.2.1, there is no email.Header. Instead of crashing
       (like previous moin 1.2.x releases), we just use the subject "as is" in
       that case. If it is not ASCII, this is not standards compliant.
     * If you have >=2.2.2 it will use email.Header to make standards compliant
       subject lines.
     * use config.mail_from as sender address when sending "lost my password"
       emails

    * file attachments:
     * fixed for standalone server
     * attachment URLs (when handled by moin) don't include server name
     * fixed some wrong &amp;amp; in html src
    
    * better themeability:
     * some entries in dict "d" where only present in header theme calls, some
       only in footer theme calls. Now almost all is present in both calls.
     * added some missing "content" divs so sidebar themes look better

    * fixed some crashes producing backtraces:
     * no IOError when diffing against deleted page
     * no backtrace in xml footnote generation
     * no SystemInfo crash when no editlog exists in new wikis
     * xmlrpc.getRecentChanges fixed

    * MoinMoin.util.filesys.rename is now a wrapper around os.rename that
      fixes os.rename on broken win32 api semantics

Other Changes:
    * saving traffic and load by improved robot meta tag generation:
     * "noindex,nofollow" on queries and POSTs
     * "index,follow" on FrontPage and TitleIndex (give robots a chance ;))
     * "index,nofollow" on all other pages (hopefully saving lots of senseless
       requests for page?action=...) 
     * removed config.html_head_queries (was used for same stuff)
    * added russian i18n (utf-8)
    * misc. other translation updates / fixes
    * added rightsidebar theme
    * TitleIndex now folds case, so "APage" and "anotherPage" are both under
      letter "A".
    * added macro/PageHits.py - it calculates the hits each page gets since
      beginning of logging



Version 1.2.1 (2004-03-08, Revision 1.184)

Fixes:
    * minimum requirement to run moin 1.2/1.2.1 is python 2.2.2
     * not: 2.2(.0), as this does not have True/False
     * not: 2.2.1, as this does not have email.Header. You maybe can work
       around that one by:
      * getting the python 2.2.x (x>=2) /usr/lib/python2.2/email directory
      * putting it into directory 'x' (whereever you like)
      * doing a sys.path[0:0] = ['x'] in moin.cgi [or other appropriate place]
      No guarantee, this is untested.
    * twisted: the http headers missed the charset data, fixed
    * mod_python: fixes for mod_python 2.7
    * wiki/data/plugin/__init__.py added - fixes not working plugin modules
    * plugin processors work now, too
    * fixed displaying non-existant translations of SiteNavigation in footer
    * fixed zh-tw iso name (wrong zh_tw -> correct zh-tw)
    * fixed reversed diffs in RecentChanges RSS
    * fixed "last change" info in footer (wasn't updated)
    * fixed event.log missing pagename (and other) information
    * fixed horizontal line thickness >1
    * fixed setup.py running from CVS workdir
    * fixed crash when doing action=info on first revision of a page
    * fixed hostname truncation in footer
    * minor css fixes
    * fixed clear msg links (they missed quoting, leading to strange page
      names when you click on some of them)
    * fixed python colorizer processor
    * fixed quoting of stats cache filenames
    * catched "bad marshal data" error when switching python versions

Other changes:
    * updated danish (da) i18n
    * updated japanese (ja) i18n
    * added serbian (sr) i18n
    * added chinese (zh) i18n
    * added a simple "viewonly" theme based on classic theme - you can use
      this as default theme, so anonymous users won't get the usual wiki stuff,
      but a far simpler (and less powerful) user interface.
      It also displays the navibar at the left side.
    * added moin.spec for building RPMs
    * included MoinMoin/i18n/* into distribution archive (nice for translators)
    * included some stuff under MoinMoin/scripts - xmlrpc-tools and account
      checking stuff. removed some version control clutter from the dist
      archive, too.


Version 1.2 (2004-02-20, Revision 1.183)

New features:
    * MoinMoin now requires Python >=2.2.2.
      You get even better results with Python2.3 (20-30% more speed,
      sometimes even much more).
    * by refactoring request processing, we made it possible to run moin under
      persistent environments:
        * twisted-web (http://twistedmatrix.com)
        * httpdmain.py (use moin.py for starting this mini server)
        * mod_python
        * FastCGI
      Of course, CGI is still possible.
    * wiki pages will be compiled to bytecode now (by default), so no need for
      slow parsing/formatting on every view ("WASP", see caching_formats)
    * when using a persistent environment (like twisted) and WASP, you get up
      to 20x speed - compared to CGI and moin 1.1
    * added support for diffs between arbitrary revisions.
    * removed requirement of the external diff utility
    * config.auth_http_enabled (defaults to 0) - use this to enable moin
      getting your authenticated user name from apache (http basic auth,
      htpasswd) - if you enable this, your basic auth username has to be the
      same as your wiki username.
      Should work with CGI, FCGI and maybe even with mod_python.
      Does not change behaviour of moin under twisted or standalone server.
    * config.tz_offset = 0.0 sets a default timezone offset (in hours
      from UTC)
    * config.cookie_lifetime (int, in hours, default 12) sets the lifetime of
      the MOIN_ID cookie:
        == 0  --> cookie will live forever (no matter what user has configured!)
        > 0   --> cookie will live for n hours (or forever when "remember_me")
        < 0   --> cookie will live for -n hours (forced, ignore "remember_me"!)
    * added themeing and some themes (if you improve the existing themes or
      make nice new ones, please contribute your stuff!). The default theme is
      set by config.theme_default (and defaults to 'classic').
    * now supporting plugin directory for parsers, processors, themes, xmlrpc.
    * action=info now defaults to showing page revision history again
    * all actions accessing the logfile (as RecentChanges or history) are now
      much faster
    * #refresh processing instruction, config.refresh
        * config.refresh = (minimum_delay, target_allowed)
            * minimum delay is the minimum waiting time (in seconds) allowed
            * target_allowed is either 'internal' or 'external', depending on
              whether you want to allow only internal redirects or also
              external ones. For internal redirects, just use the Wiki pagename,
              for external, use http://... url.
        * #refresh 3                    == refresh this page every 3 seconds
        * #refresh 5 FrontPage          == internal redirect to FrontPage in 5s
        * #refresh 5 http://google.com/ == redirect to google in 5s
      Use very carefully! Allowing a low minimum_delay and putting a #refresh
      on RecentChanges might slow down your wiki significantly, when some
      people just let their browser refresh and refresh again. Also, it does
      cause quite some traffic long-term. So better do not use this without
      good reason! Default is None (switched off).
    * hide most UserPreferences options before user has logged in, less
      confusing for new users
    * "config.page_dict_regex" defines what pages are dictionary definitions
      Currently dictionaries are used for UserHomePage/MyDict where you can
      define key:: value pairs that get processed like @DATE@ expansion when
      saving a page. The 2 "@" will be added to your keys automatically.
      Please do not use @xxx@ strings on the right side (value), results may
      vary if you do.
      You can also access wiki dictionaries by using the internal macro
      [[GetVal(page,key)]]" - that will go to page "page" and return the
      value (right side) corresponding to "key".
      Implementation note: groups are a subset of the dictionary functionality.
    * standalone server should work now (see cgi-bin/moin.py), so you don't
      need to setup apache or twisted for a local personal wiki, you only need
      python and moin for that now, no additional stuff any more!
    * if you run your wiki with charset = "utf-8" (the default is still
      iso8859-1), you might want to have a look at contributions/utf8-pages/
      to see if there are already translated system pages for your language.

Fixes:
    * new importPlugin routine (the old one didn't work correctly)
    * removed 0xA0 characters breaking utf-8
    * system page recognition now uses wiki groups (see AllSystemPagesGroup),
      fixing the long-time broken system page exclusion on TitleIndex.
    * mostly HTML 4.01 Strict compliant HTML
    * design is done by CSS now, HTML is semantic markup only 
    * removed target attribute from links, also [^NewWindow] markup - this
      is a HTML 3.2 feature and not valid in HTML 4.01
    * updated TWikiDrawPlugin to 20021003 version, with further modifications
      including source. It can draw imagemaps now!
    * fixed email headers and encoding
    * Changed moin-usercheck to adhere to scripting standards; no
      proprietary config changes needed any more (added --config);
      --wikinames is now part of the usage message.
    * config.umask now defaults to 0770 - if you give world r/w access, ACLs
      could be rather pointless...

Other:
    * lots of internal code refactoring and optimization
    * began moving src code documentation to epydoc, see "make epydoc"

Known problems:
    * theme support is neither complete (although covering most important
      stuff) nor perfect - work on that will continue...
    * we removed some html from system messages (the boxes at top of page you
      get after some actions), so it currently looks less nice than before.
    * html is not completely validating and it is not xhtml - this will be
      fixed as soon as we have the infrastructure for that (other parser, DOM)
    * problems with rtl (right-to-left) languages, will be fixed in 1.3
    * if you change moin_config or switch themes, moin will still use already
      cached page content. For the config this can be fixed by touching
      MoinMoin/version.py (or simply deleting everything in
      data/cache/Page.py). If you get more annoyed by this than pleased by
      caching speedup, you can also switch off caching (see docs on
      caching_formats).


Version 1.1 (2003-11-29, Revision 1.178)

New features:
  Configuration:
    * config.default_lang lets you set a default language for users not
      having specified language in their browser or UserPreferences
    * "config.page_category_regex" defines what pages are categories
    * replaced `config.page_template_ending` by a more flexible setting
      named `config.page_template_regex`
    * the same with config.page_form_regex
    * "config.page_group_regex" defines what pages are group definitions
      Currently groups are used for "user groups" (see ACLs) and "page
      groups" (see AllSystemPagesGroup).
    * robot exclusion from all pages except the standard view action,
      via the config.ua_spiders regex (reduces server load)
    * "maxdepth" argument for the TableOfContents macro
    * config.title1, config.title2, config.page_footer1,
      config.page_footer2 can now be callables and will be called with
      the "request" object as a single argument (note that you should
      accept any keyword arguments in order to be compatible to future
      changes)
    * "config.html_pagetitle" allows you to set a specific HTML page
      title (if not set, it defaults to "config.sitename")
    * navi_bar / quicklinks can now contain free-form links, i.e.
      entries of the form "[url linktext]" just like in wiki pages
    * if a quick link starts with '^', it opens in a new window; help
      now opens in a new window also
    * `config.smileys` for user-defined smileys
    * `config.hosts_deny` to forbid access based on IP address
    * `config.mail_login` can be set to "user pwd", if you need to
      use SMTP AUTH
    * `config.edit_locking` can be set to None (old behaviour, no
      locking), 'warn <timeout mins>' (warn about concurrent edits, but
      do not enforce anything), or 'lock <timeout mins>' (strict locking)
    * optionally showing a license text on editor page, use:
      config.page_license_enabled = 1
      Optionally use these to customize what is shown there:
      config.page_license_text = "... your text ..."
      config.page_license_page = "MyLicensePage"
      See the default values in MoinMoin/config.py for details and
      override them in moin_config.py, if needed.
    * `config.shared_intermap` can be a list of filenames (instead of a
      single string)

  Authenticaton / Authorization:
    * added ACL support, written by Gustavo Niemeyer of Conectiva and
      Thomas Waldmann. See HelpOnAccessControlLists for more infos.
      You should use MoinMoin/scripts/moin_usercheck.py before activating
      ACLs or some users with bad or duplicate accounts might get into
      trouble.
    * A user account can be disabled using moin_usercheck.py or
      UserPreferences page. Disabling, but keeping it is good for edit
      history.
    * changed security default: deletion only available to known users
    * support for Basic authentication (Apache style: AUTH_TYPE="Basic",
      REMOTE_USER="WikiUserName"). If authentication is there, user
      will be in ACL class "Trusted".
    * support for username / password login
      The username / password login will ONLY work, if you define a
      password. With an empty password, username / password login is not
      allowed due to security reasons. Passwords are stored encrypted
      (format similar to Apache SHA) and can also be entered in the
      UserPreferences form in this format. When requesting login
      information by email, the password is also sent in this encrypted
      format (use copy&paste to fill it in the form).
      ...?action=userform?uid=<userid> is still possible, so if you have
      bookmarks, they will still work). The input field for the ID was
      dropped.
      NOTE: using the userid for login purposes is DEPRECATED and might
            be removed for better security soon.
    * after logging in, you will get a cookie valid until midnight.
      The next day, the cookie will expire and you will have to login
      again. If you don't want this, you can check the "remember me
      forever" option in UserPreferences.
    * if the page file is read-only, you get a message (i.e. you can now
      protect pages against changes if you're the wiki admin).
      Note: you can do that easier using ACLs.

  Markup / Macros / Actions:
    * RandomQuote macro (and even parses Wiki markup now)
    * `[[Navigation]]` macro for slides and subpage navigation
    * [[ShowSmileys]] displays ALL smileys, including user-defined ones
    * the Include macro has new parameters (from, to, sort, items) and
      is able to include more than one page (via a regex pattern)
    * `MailTo` macro for adding spam-safe email links to a page
    * if a fancy link starts with '^' (i.e. if it has the form
      "[^http:... ...]"), it's opened in a new window
     * because of that, the NewWindow macro was removed from contrib
    * "#pragma section-numbers 2" only displays section numbers for
      headings of level 2 and up (similarly for 3 to 6)
    * ../SubPageOfParent links

  User interface:
    * new fancy diffs
    * Page creation shows LikePages that already exist
    * editor shows the current size of the page
    * editor returns to including page when editing an included page
    * Visual indication we're on the editor page (new CSS style)
    * selection to add categories to a page in the editor (use preview
      button to add more than one category)
    * if user has a homepage, a backup of save/preview text is saved as
      a subpage UsersHomePage/MoinEditorBackup
    * added "revert" link to PageInfo view (which makes DeletePage more
      safe in public wikis, since you can easily revive deleted pages
      via revert)
    * Selection for logged in users (i.e. no bots) to extend the listing
      of recent changes beyond the default limits
    * Activated display of context for backlinks search
    * Subscriber list shown on page info
    * LikePages shows similar pages (using difflib.get_close_matches)
    * last edit action is stored into "last-edited" file, and
      displayed in the page footer
    * reciprocal footnote linking (definition refers back to reference)
    * "Ex-/Include system pages" link for title index
      Note: system/help pages algorithm is still mostly broken.
    * list items set apart by empty lines are now also set apart
      visually (by adding the CSS class "gap" to <li>)
    * "save" check for security.Permissions
    * Added Spanish, Croatian and Danish system texts
    * Added flag icons for the languages supported in "i18n"
    * updated help and system pages, more translations, see also
      AllSystemPagesGroup
    * there was quite some work done on wiki xmlrpc v1 and v2 - it
      basically works now.

  Tools and other changes:
    * moin-dump: New option "--page"
    * there are some scripts MoinMoin/scripts/* using wiki xmlrpc for
      backup and wiki page copying applications
    * Updated the XSLT parser to work with 4Suite 1.0a1
    * more infos in cgi tracebacks
    * UPDATE.html is a HTML version of MoinMaster:HelpOnUpdating

Unfinished or experimental features:
    * user defined forms
    * XML export of all data in the wiki
    * RST parser (you need to install docutils to use this)
    * SystemAdmin macro

Privacy fixes:
    * do not use / display user's email address in public places

SECURITY FIXES:
    * Removed two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities reported by "office"

Bugfixes:
    * Bugfix for PageList when no arguments are given
    * Disallow full-text searches with too short search terms
    * [ 566094 ] TitleIndex now supports grouping by Hangul Syllables
     * fix for multibyte first char in TitleIndex
    * Footnotes were not HTML escaped
    * Numbered code displays are now in a table so that you can cut the
      code w/o the numbers
    * Bugfix for wrong mail notifications
    * Create unique anchors for repeated titles

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 (2002-05-10, Revision 1.159)

THIS IS THE LAST RELEASE WITH PYTHON 1.5.2 SUPPORT! If severe bugs
should occur, a maintenance release will fix them.

New features:
    * security fix: "allow_xslt" has to be set to 1 in order to enable
      XSLT processing; note that this defaults to 0 because XSLT is able
      to insert arbitrary HTML into a wiki
    * "action=content" for transclusion into static web pages; emits the
      pure page content, without any <html>, <head>, or <body> tags
    * "?action=links&mimetype=text/plain" works like MeatBall:LinkDatabase
    * "Preferred language" and "Quick links" user settings
    * Added "processor" concept, processors work on the data in "code
      displays" and are called by a bangpath in the first line of data
    * Processors: Colorize, CSV (see HelpOnProcessors)
    * New icons: "{OK}", "(./)", "{X}", "{i}", "{1}", "{2}" and "{}"
      (see HelpOnSmileys)
    * FullSearch now displays context information for search hits
    * DeletePage offers a textentry field for an optional comment
    * Email notifications are sent in the user's language, if known from
      the preferences
    * @PAGE@ is substituted by the name of the current page (useful
      for template pages)

Unfinished features:
    * user defined forms
    * XML export of all data in the wiki
    * RST parser (you need to install docutils to use this)
    * XMLRPC interface

Bugfixes:
    * Syntax warning with Python 2.2 fixed
    * Macro-generated pagelinks are no longer added to the list of links
    * error codes returned by "diff" are reported
    * fix for attachments on pages with non-USASCII names
    * correct handling of spaces in attachment filenames and URLs

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.11 (2002-03-11, Revision 1.151)

Most important new features: file attachments, definition list markup
(glossaries), change notification via email, variable substitution when
saving pages, edit preview, and improved documentation.

Note that the RSS features require a recent PyXML (CVS or 0.7) due to
bugs in the namespace handling of xml.sax.saxutils in earlier versions.
This is (hopefully) automatically detected on every installation.

Statistical features are NOT designed to work with Python 1.5.2 and
require Python 2.0 or higher. Overall, MoinMoin 0.11 is not explicitely
tested for 1.5.2 compatibility.

New features:
    * XML formatting now (most often) produces well-formed, and, depending
      on proper layout of the wiki page, valid StyleBook XML
    * Headers are now automatically numbered, unless you set the config
      item 'show_section_numbers' to 0
    * "#pragma section-numbers off" (or "0") switches that off explicitely,
      and "on" or "1" enables numbering 
    * Added a "contributions" directory for 3rd party extensions
    * AttachFile action, contributed by Ken Sugino; note that you have
      to enable this action because of the possibility of DoS attacks
      (malicious uploads), by adding this to your moin_config:
            allowed_actions = ['AttachFile']
    * "attachment:" URL scheme allows access to attachments, to get files
       from other pages use "attachment:WikiName/filename.ext".
    * New macros: Date(unixtimestamp) and DateTime(unixtimestamp) to
      display a timestamp according to system/user settings
    * Variable substitution when a page is saved, note that saving
      template pages does NOT expand variables. Supported are:
        @DATE@      Current date in the system's format
        @TIME@      Current date and time in the user's format
        @USERNAME@  Just the user's name (or his domain/IP)
        @USER@      Signature "-- loginname"
        @SIG@       Dated Signature "-- loginname date time"
        @MAILTO@    A fancy mailto: link with the user's data  
    * Copied some new emoticons from PikiePikie
        || {{{ :-? }}} || :-? || tongue.gif ||
        || {{{ :\  }}} || :\  || ohwell.gif ||
        || {{{ >:> }}} || >:> || devil.gif  ||
        || {{{ %)  }}} || %)  || eyes.gif   ||
        || {{{ @)  }}} || @)  || eek.gif    ||
        || {{{ |)  }}} || |)  || tired.gif  ||
        || {{{ ;)) }}} || ;)) || lol.gif    ||
    * AbandonedPages macro
    * Added definition list markup: {{{<whitespace>term:: definition}}}
    * Added email notification features contributed by Daniel Saß
    * SystemInfo: show "Entries in edit log"
    * Added "RSS" icon to RecentChanges macro and code to generate a
      RecentChanges RSS channel, see
          http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?UnifiedRecentChanges
      for details
    * Added config.sitename and config.interwikiname parameter
    * Better WikiFarm support:
      * <datadir>/plugin/macro and <datadir>/plugin/action can be used
        to store macros and actions local to a specific wiki instance
      * config.shared_intermap can contain a pathname to a shared
        "intermap.txt" file (i.e. one stored outside the datadir)
    * added `backtick` shortcut for {{{inline literal}}} (has to be
      enabled by "backtick_meta=1" in the config file); note that ``
      is then a shorter replacement for '''''' escaping
    * added inline search fields (at the bottom of each page)
    * Added preview to the editor, including spell checking
    * New languages: Chinese (Changzhe Han) and Portuguese (Jorge
      Godoy), updated French (Lucas Bruand), added Korean (Hye-Shik
      Chang) and Italian (Lele Gaifax)
    * New SystemAdmin macro
    * `[[Anchor(anchorname)]]` macro to insert anchors into a page,
      and [#anchorname Anchor Links].
    * User option to open editor view via a double-click
    * Added commentary field to editor, recent changes and page info
    * Page trails (user option)
    * UserPreferences: checkboxes for double-click edit, page trail,
      fancy links, emoticons, jump to last page visited, and some
      other yes/no options
    * "config.nonexist_qm" is now the default for a user setting
    * `[[GetText(text)]]` macro loads I18N texts (mainly intended
      for use on Help pages)
    * table attributes via "||<attrlist> ... ||", more details on
      http://purl.net/wiki/moin/HelpOnTables
    * PythonFaq interwiki tag and support for $PAGE placeholder
    * event logging, as the basis for future statistics
    * "moin-dump" command line tool to create a static copy of
      the wiki content
    * "config.external_diff" allows to set an exact path to the
      command, or change the name to for example "gdiff" if GNU
      diff is not a native command in your UNIX flavour
    * `[[PageSize]]` macro
    * the interwiki name "Self" now always points to the own wiki
    * config.title1 and config.title2 are inserted into the output
      right before and after the system title html code (title1
      is right after the <body> tag and normally undefined, title2
      defaults to the "<hr>" above the page contents)
    * Additional link on diff pages to ignore whitespace changes
    * Subpages (config.allow_subpages, config.page_icons_up)
    * super^script^, sub,,script,, and __underline__ markup
    * `[[FootNote]]` macro
    * many other new config options, see HelpOnConfiguration for
      a complete list
    * [[StatsChart(type)]] shows statistical charts (currently
      defined types: hitcounts, pagesize, useragents)
    * 'inline:' scheme works like 'attachment:', but tries to
      inline the content of the attachment into the page;
      currently knows about "*.py" sources and colorizes them
    * support for Java applet "TWikiDrawPlugin" via
      drawing:<drawingname> URL scheme (you need to activate
      the AttachFile action if you want drawings)
    * numeric entities (&#nnnnn;) are now optionally NOT escaped,
      which allows you to insert more characters into a Latin-1
      page, especially the Euro symbol
    * navi_bar is now a list of page names which should be linked
      on every page
    * test.cgi is now rolled into moin.cgi, and can be called
      by adding "?test" to the wiki base URL. Also, as a security
      feature, the server's environment is only shown for requests
      local to the web server.

Unfinished features:
    * user defined forms
    * XML export of all data in the wiki

Documentation:
    * extended the online help ("Help*" pages)
    * German help pages (thanks to Thomas Waldmann)

Bugfixes:

    * #424917: Caching control
    * #465499: Two HTTPS problems
    * #491155: FrontPage hardcoded
    * Handling of inbound UTF-8 encoded URIs (only with Python >= 2.0)
    * Fix for subtle changes in "re" of Python 2.2
    * User-provided URLs are now never URL-escaped, which allows appending
      #anchors and using %20 for spaces in InterWiki links

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.10 (2001-10-28, Revision 1.134)

This version is still Python 1.5.2 compatible, but it's not extensively
tested for that version and some parts of the system might not work
there, especially seldom used macros and actions. Bug reports welcome!

New features:
    * "#deprecated" processing instruction
    * config entry "SecurityPolicy" to allow for customized permissions
      (see "security.py" for more)
    * added distutils support
    * though not extensively tested, the standalone server now does POST
      requests, i.e. you can save pages; there are still problems with
      persistent global variables! It only works for Python >= 2.0.
    * "bang_meta" config variable and "!NotWikiWord" markup
    * "url_mappings" config variable to dynamically change URL prefixes
      (especially useful in intranets, when whole trees of externally
      hosted documents move around)
    * setting "mail_smarthost" and "mail_from" activates mailing
      features (sending login data on the UserPreferences page)
    * very useful for intranet developer wikis, a means to view pydoc
      documentation, formatted via a XSLT stylesheet, for details see
      http://purl.net/wiki/python/TeudViewer?module=MoinMoin.macro.TeudView
      or MoinMoin/macro/TeudView.py
    * "LocalSiteMap" action by Steve Howell <showell@zipcon.com>
    * Added FOLDOC to intermap.txt

Bugfixes:
    * Full config defaults, import MoinMoin now works w/o moin_config.py
    * Better control over permissions with config.umask
    * Bugfix for a UNIX time billenium bug (affecting RecentChanges
      sorting and page diffs)
    * data paths with directory names containing dots caused problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9 (2001-05-07)

New features:
    * XML page input (pages that start with "<?xml") and XSLT formatting
    * Page caching, for now limited to XSLT processing (where it's
      absolutely needed); new code & API to add the "RefreshCache" link
    * Selection of common date/time formats in UserPreferences
    * New action "titleindex" to support wiki introspection (MetaWiki);
      see the new links below the index bar in "TitleIndex"

    * PageInfo: the editor's name or IP is shown for each change
    * WantedPages: a new macro that lists links to non-existent pages

    * "PageList" results are now sorted
    * New config parameter "html_head_queries": send additional header
      for all pages EXCEPT the "normal" view; main usage is to have
      only the normal pages indexed by a spider, not the edit, print,
      etc. views (which cause multiple hits on the same information)
    * Store the modification time of the page file in the editlog, not
      the current time when the log entry is created

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

New features:
    * When saving, a datestamp saved in the form and that of the file are
